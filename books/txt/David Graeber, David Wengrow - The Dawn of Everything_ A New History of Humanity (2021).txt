Farewell to Humanity’ s Childhood
Or, why this is not a book about the origins of inequality
‘This mood makes itself felt everywher e, politically , socially , and
philosophically . We are living in what the Gr eeks called the καιρóς
(Kair os) – the right time – for a “metamorphosis of the gods,” i.e. of
the fundamental principles and symbols.’
C. G. Jung, The Undiscover ed Self  (1958)
Most of human history is irreparably lost to us. Our species, Homo sapiens ,
has existed for at least 200,000 years, but for most of that time we have next
to no idea what was happening. In northern Spain, for instance, at the cave
of Altamira, paintings and engravings were created over a period of at least
10,000 years, between around 25,000 and 15,000 BC. Presumably , a lot of
dramatic events occurred during this period. W e have no way of knowing
what most of them were.
This is of little consequence to most people, since most people rarely
think about the broad sweep of human history anyway . They don’ t have
much reason to. Insofar as the question comes up at all, it’ s usually when
reﬂecting on why the world seems to be in such a mess and why human
beings so often treat each other badly – the reasons for war , greed,
exploitation, systematic indif ference to others’ suf fering. W ere we always
like that, or did something, at some point, go terribly wrong?
It is basically a theological debate. Essentially the question is: are
humans innately good or innately evil? But if you think about it, the
question, framed in these terms, makes very little sense. ‘Good’ and ‘evil’
are purely human concepts. It would never occur to anyone to argue about
whether a ﬁsh, or a tree, were good or evil, because ‘good’ and ‘evil’ areconcepts humans made up in order to compare ourselves with one another .
It follows that ar guing about whether humans are fundamentally good or
evil makes about as much sense as ar guing about whether humans are
fundamentally fat or thin.
Nonetheless, on those occasions when people do reﬂect on the lessons of
prehistory , they almost invariably come back to questions of this kind. W e
are all familiar with the Christian answer: people once lived in a state of
innocence, yet were tainted by original sin. W e desired to be godlike and
have been punished for it; now we live in a fallen state while hoping for
future redemption. T oday , the popular version of this story is typically some
updated variation on Jean-Jacques Rousseau’ s Discourse on the Origin and
the Foundation of Inequality Among Mankind , which he wrote in 1754.
Once upon a time, the story goes, we were hunter -gatherers, living in a
prolonged state of childlike innocence, in tiny bands. These bands were
egalitarian; they could be for the very reason that they were so small. It was
only after the ‘Agricultural Revolution’, and then still more the rise of
cities, that this happy condition came to an end, ushering in ‘civilization’
and ‘the state’ – which also meant the appearance of written literature,
science and philosophy , but at the same time, almost everything bad in
human life: patriarchy , standing armies, mass executions and annoying
bureaucrats demanding that we spend much of our lives ﬁlling in forms.
Of course, this is a very crude simpliﬁcation, but it really does seem to be
the foundational story that rises to the surface whenever anyone, from
industrial psychologists to revolutionary theorists, says something like ‘but
of course human beings spent most of their evolutionary history living in
groups of ten or twenty people,’ or ‘agriculture was perhaps humanity’ s
worst mistake.’ And as we’ll see, many popular writers make the ar gument
quite explicitly . The problem is that anyone seeking an alternative to this
rather depressing view of history will quickly ﬁnd that the only one on of fer
is actually even worse: if not Rousseau, then Thomas Hobbes.
Hobbes’ s Leviathan , published in 1651, is in many ways the founding
text of modern political theory . It held that, humans being the selﬁsh
creatures they are, life in an original State of Nature was in no sense
innocent; it must instead have been ‘solitary , poor , nasty , brutish, and short’
– basically , a state of war , with everybody ﬁghting against everybody else.
Insofar as there has been any progress from this benighted state of af fairs, a
Hobbesian would ar gue, it has been lar gely due to exactly those repressivemechanisms that Rousseau was complaining about: governments, courts,
bureaucracies, police. This view of things has been around for a very long
time as well. There’ s a reason why , in English, the words ‘politics’ ‘polite’
and ‘police’ all sound the same – they’re all derived from the Greek word
polis , or city , the Latin equivalent of which is civitas , which also gives us
‘civility ,’ ‘civic’ and a certain modern understanding of ‘civilization’.
Human society , in this view , is founded on the collective repression of
our baser instincts, which becomes all the more necessary when humans are
living in lar ge numbers in the same place. The modern-day Hobbesian,
then, would ar gue that, yes, we did live most of our evolutionary history in
tiny bands, who could get along mainly because they shared a common
interest in the survival of their of fspring (‘parental investment’, as
evolutionary biologists call it). But even these were in no sense founded on
equality . There was always, in this version, some ‘alpha-male’ leader .
Hierarchy and domination, and cynical self-interest, have always been the
basis of human society . It’s just that, collectively , we have learned it’ s to our
advantage to prioritize our long-term interests over our short-term instincts;
or, better , to create laws that force us to conﬁne our worst impulses to
socially useful areas like the economy , while forbidding them everywhere
else.
As the reader can probably detect from our tone, we don’ t much like the
choice between these two alternatives. Our objections can be classiﬁed into
three broad categories. As accounts of the general course of human history ,
they:
1. simply aren’ t true;
2. have dire political implications;
3. make the past needlessly dull.
This book is an attempt to begin to tell another , more hopeful and more
interesting story; one which, at the same time, takes better account of what
the last few decades of research have taught us. Partly , this is a matter of
bringing together evidence that has accumulated in archaeology ,
anthropology and kindred disciplines; evidence that points towards a
completely new account of how human societies developed over roughly
the last 30,000 years. Almost all of this research goes against the familiar
narrative, but too often the most remarkable discoveries remain conﬁned tothe work of specialists, or have to be teased out by reading between the
lines of scientiﬁc publications.
To give just a sense of how dif ferent the emer ging picture is: it is clear
now that human societies before the advent of farming were not conﬁned to
small, egalitarian bands. On the contrary , the world of hunter -gatherers as it
existed before the coming of agriculture was one of bold social
experiments, resembling a carnival parade of political forms, far more than
it does the drab abstractions of evolutionary theory . Agriculture, in turn, did
not mean the inception of private property , nor did it mark an irreversible
step towards inequality . In fact, many of the ﬁrst farming communities were
relatively free of ranks and hierarchies. And far from setting class
differences in stone, a surprising number of the world’ s earliest cities were
organized on robustly egalitarian lines, with no need for authoritarian rulers,
ambitious warrior -politicians, or even bossy administrators.
Information bearing on such issues has been pouring in from every
quarter of the globe. As a result, researchers around the world have also
been examining ethnographic and historical material in a new light. The
pieces now exist to create an entirely dif ferent world history – but so far ,
they remain hidden to all but a few privileged experts (and even the experts
tend to hesitate before abandoning their own tiny part of the puzzle, to
compare notes with others outside their speciﬁc subﬁeld). Our aim in this
book is to start putting some of the pieces of the puzzle together , in full
awareness that nobody yet has anything like a complete set. The task is
immense, and the issues so important, that it will take years of research and
debate even to begin to understand the real implications of the picture we’re
starting to see. But it’ s crucial that we set the process in motion. One thing
that will quickly become clear is that the prevalent ‘big picture’ of history –
shared by modern-day followers of Hobbes and Rousseau alike – has
almost nothing to do with the facts. But to begin making sense of the new
information that’ s now before our eyes, it is not enough to compile and sift
vast quantities of data. A conceptual shift is also required.
To make that shift means retracing some of the initial steps that led to our
modern notion of social evolution: the idea that human societies could be
arranged according to stages of development, each with their own
characteristic technologies and forms of or ganization (hunter -gatherers,
farmers, urban-industrial society , and so on). As we will see, such notions
have their roots in a conservative backlash against critiques of Europeancivilization, which began to gain ground in the early decades of the
eighteenth century . The origins of that critique, however , lie not with the
philosophers of the Enlightenment (much though they initially admired and
imitated it), but with indigenous commentators and observers of European
society , such as the Native American (Huron-W endat) statesman
Kandiaronk, of whom we will learn much more in the next chapter .
Revisiting what we will call the ‘indigenous critique’ means taking
seriously contributions to social thought that come from outside the
European canon, and in particular from those indigenous peoples whom
Western philosophers tend to cast either in the role of history’ s angels or its
devils. Both positions preclude any real possibility of intellectual exchange,
or even dialogue: it’ s just as hard to debate someone who is considered
diabolical as someone considered divine, as almost anything they think or
say is likely to be deemed either irrelevant or deeply profound. Most of the
people we will be considering in this book are long since dead. It is no
longer possible to have any sort of conversation with them. W e are
nonetheless determined to write prehistory as if it consisted of people one
would have been able to talk to, when they were still alive – who don’ t just
exist as paragons, specimens, sock-puppets or playthings of some
inexorable law of history .
There are, certainly , tendencies in history . Some are powerful; currents so
strong that they are very difﬁcult to swim against (though there always
seem to be some who manage to do it anyway). But the only ‘laws’ are
those we make up ourselves. Which brings us on to our second objection.
WHY BOTH THE HOBBESIAN AND ROUSSEAUIAN VERSIONS
OF HUMAN HIST ORY HA VE DIRE POLITICAL IMPLICA TIONS
The political implications of the Hobbesian model need little elaboration. It
is a foundational assumption of our economic system that humans are at
base somewhat nasty and selﬁsh creatures, basing their decisions on
cynical, egoistic calculation rather than altruism or co-operation; in which
case, the best we can hope for are more sophisticated internal and external
controls on our supposedly innate drive towards accumulation and self-
aggrandizement. Rousseau’ s story about how humankind descended into
inequality from an original state of egalitarian innocence seems more
optimistic (at least there was somewhere better to fall from), but nowadaysit’s mostly deployed to convince us that while the system we live under
might be unjust, the most we can realistically aim for is a bit of modest
tinkering. The term ‘inequality’ is itself very telling in this regard.
Since the ﬁnancial crash of 2008, and the upheavals that followed, the
question of inequality – and with it, the long-term history of inequality –
have become major topics for debate. Something of a consensus has
emer ged among intellectuals and even, to some degree, the political classes
that levels of social inequality have got out of hand, and that most of the
world’ s problems result, in one way or another , from an ever -widening gulf
between the haves and the have-nots. Pointing this out is in itself a
challenge to global power structures; at the same time, though, it frames the
issue in a way that people who beneﬁt from those structures can still ﬁnd
ultimately reassuring, since it implies no meaningful solution to the
problem would ever be possible.
After all, imagine we framed the problem dif ferently , the way it might
have been ﬁfty or 100 years ago: as the concentration of capital, or
oligopoly , or class power . Compared to any of these, a word like
‘inequality’ sounds like it’ s practically designed to encourage half-measures
and compromise. It’ s possible to imagine overthrowing capitalism or
breaking the power of the state, but it’ s not clear what eliminating
inequality would even mean. (Which kind of inequality? W ealth?
Opportunity? Exactly how equal would people have to be in order for us to
be able to say we’ve ‘eliminated inequality’?) The term ‘inequality’ is a
way of framing social problems appropriate to an age of technocratic
reformers, who assume from the outset that no real vision of social
transformation is even on the table.
Debating inequality allows one to tinker with the numbers, ar gue about
Gini coefﬁcients and thresholds of dysfunction, readjust tax regimes or
social welfare mechanisms, even shock the public with ﬁgures showing just
how bad things have become (‘Can you imagine? The richest 1 per cent of
the world’ s population own 44 per cent of the world’ s wealth!’) – but it also
allows one to do all this without addressing any of the factors that people
actually object to about such ‘unequal’ social arrangements: for instance,
that some manage to turn their wealth into power over others; or that other
people end up being told their needs are not important, and their lives have
no intrinsic worth. The last, we are supposed to believe, is just the
inevitable ef fect of inequality; and inequality , the inevitable result of livingin any lar ge, complex, urban, technologically sophisticated society .
Presumably it will always be with us. It’ s just a matter of degree.
Today , there is a veritable boom of thinking about inequality: since 201 1,
‘global inequality’ has regularly featured as a top item for debate in the
World Economic Forum at Davos. There are inequality indexes, institutes
for the study of inequality , and a relentless stream of publications trying to
project the current obsession with property distribution back into the Stone
Age. There have even been attempts to calculate income levels and Gini
coefﬁcients for Palaeolithic mammoth hunters (they both turn out to be very
low).1 It’s almost as if we feel some need to come up with mathematical
formulae justifying the expression, already popular in the days of Rousseau,
that in such societies ‘everyone was equal, because they were all equally
poor.’
The ultimate ef fect of all these stories about an original state of
innocence and equality , like the use of the term ‘inequality’ itself, is to
make wistful pessimism about the human condition seem like common
sense: the natural result of viewing ourselves through history’ s broad lens.
Yes, living in a truly egalitarian society might be possible if you’re a Pygmy
or a Kalahari Bushman. But if you want to create a society of true equality
today , you’re going to have to ﬁgure out a way to go back to becoming tiny
bands of foragers again with no signiﬁcant personal property . Since foragers
require a pretty extensive territory to forage in, this would mean having to
reduce the world’ s population by something like 99.9 per cent. Otherwise,
the best we can hope for is to adjust the size of the boot that will forever be
stomping on our faces; or , perhaps, to wangle a bit more wiggle room in
which some of us can temporarily duck out of its way .
A ﬁrst step towards a more accurate, and hopeful, picture of world history
might be to abandon the Garden of Eden once and for all, and simply do
away with the notion that for hundreds of thousands of years, everyone on
earth shared the same idyllic form of social or ganization. Strangely enough,
though, this is often seen as a reactionary move. ‘So are you saying true
equality has never been achieved? That it’ s therefore impossible?’ It seems
to us that such objections are both counterproductive and frankly
unrealistic.
First of all, it’ s bizarre to imagine that, say , during the roughly 10,000
(some would say more like 20,000) years in which people painted on thewalls of Altamira, no one – not only in Altamira, but anywhere on earth –
experimented with alternative forms of social or ganization. What’ s the
chance of that? Second of all, is not the capacity to experiment with
different forms of social or ganization itself a quintessential part of what
makes us human? That is, beings with the capacity for self-creation, even
freedom? The ultimate question of human history , as we’ll see, is not our
equal access to material resources (land, calories, means of production),
much though these things are obviously important, but our equal capacity to
contribute to decisions about how to live together . Of course, to exercise
that capacity implies that there should be something meaningful to decide in
the ﬁrst place.
If, as many are suggesting, our species’ future now hinges on our
capacity to create something dif ferent (say , a system in which wealth cannot
be freely transformed into power , or where some people are not told their
needs are unimportant, or that their lives have no intrinsic worth), then what
ultimately matters is whether we can rediscover the freedoms that make us
human in the ﬁrst place. As long ago as 1936, the prehistorian V . Gordon
Childe wrote a book called Man Makes Himself . Apart from the sexist
language, this is the spirit we wish to invoke. W e are projects of collective
self-creation. What if we approached human history that way? What if we
treat people, from the beginning, as imaginative, intelligent, playful
creatures who deserve to be understood as such? What if, instead of telling
a story about how our species fell from some idyllic state of equality , we
ask how we came to be trapped in such tight conceptual shackles that we
can no longer even imagine the possibility of reinventing ourselves?
SOME BRIEF EXAMPLES OF WHY RECEIVED
UNDERST ANDINGS OF THE BROAD SWEEP OF HUMAN
HIST ORY ARE MOSTL Y WRONG (OR, THE ETERNAL RETURN
OF JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU)
When we ﬁrst embarked on this book, our intention was to seek new
answers to questions about the origins of social inequality . It didn’ t take
long before we realized this simply wasn’ t a very good approach. Framing
human history in this way – which necessarily means assuming humanity
once existed in an idyllic state, and that a speciﬁc point can be identiﬁed at
which everything started to go wrong – made it almost impossible to askany of the questions we felt were genuinely interesting. It felt like almost
everyone else seemed to be caught in the same trap. Specialists were
refusing to generalize. Those few willing to stick their necks out almost
invariably reproduced some variation on Rousseau.
Let’s consider a fairly random example of one of these generalist
accounts, Francis Fukuyama’ s The Origins of Political Or der: Fr om
Prehuman T imes to the Fr ench Revolution  (201 1). Here is Fukuyama on
what he feels can be taken as received wisdom about early human societies:
‘In its early stages human political or ganization is similar to the band-level
society observed in higher primates like chimpanzees,’ which Fukuyama
suggests can be regarded as ‘a default form of social or ganization’. He then
goes on to assert that Rousseau was lar gely correct in pointing out that the
origin of political inequality lay in the development of agriculture, since
hunter -gatherer societies (according to Fukuyama) have no concept of
private property , and so little incentive to mark out a piece of land and say ,
‘This is mine.’ Band-level societies of this sort, he suggests, are ‘highly
egalitarian’.2
Jared Diamond, in The W orld Until Y ester day: What Can W e Learn fr om
Traditional Societies?  (2012) suggests that such bands (in which he
believes humans still lived ‘as recently as 1 1,000 years ago’) comprised
‘just a few dozen individuals’, most biologically related. These small
groups led a fairly meagre existence, ‘hunting and gathering whatever wild
animal and plant species happen to live in an acre of forest’. And their
social lives, according to Diamond, were enviably simple. Decisions were
reached through ‘face-to-face discussion’; there were ‘few personal
possessions’ and ‘no formal political leadership or strong economic
specialization’.3 Diamond concludes that, sadly , it is only within such
primordial groupings that humans ever achieved a signiﬁcant degree of
social equality .
For Diamond and Fukuyama, as for Rousseau some centuries earlier ,
what put an end to that equality – everywhere and forever – was the
invention of agriculture, and the higher population levels it sustained.
Agriculture brought about a transition from ‘bands’ to ‘tribes’.
Accumulation of food surplus fed population growth, leading some ‘tribes’
to develop into ranked societies known as ‘chiefdoms’. Fukuyama paints an
almost explicitly biblical picture of this process, a departure from Eden: ‘As
little bands of human beings migrated and adapted to dif ferentenvironments, they began their exit out of the state of nature by developing
new social institutions.’4 They fought wars over resources. Gangly and
pubescent, these societies were clearly heading for trouble.
It was time to grow up and appoint some proper leadership. Hierarchies
began to emer ge. There was no point in resisting, since hierarchy –
according to Diamond and Fukuyama – is inevitable once humans adopt
large, complex forms of or ganization. Even when the new leaders began
acting badly – creaming of f agricultural surplus to promote their ﬂunkies
and relatives, making status permanent and hereditary , collecting trophy
skulls and harems of slave-girls, or tearing out rivals’ hearts with obsidian
knives – there could be no going back. Before long, chiefs had managed to
convince others they should be referred to as ‘kings’, even ‘emperors’. As
Diamond patiently explains to us:
Large populations can’ t function without leaders who make the
decisions, executives who carry out the decisions, and bureaucrats
who administer the decisions and laws. Alas for all of you readers
who are anarchists and dream of living without any state
government, those are the reasons why your dream is unrealistic:
you’ll have to ﬁnd some tiny band or tribe willing to accept you,
where no one is a stranger , and where kings, presidents, and
bureaucrats are unnecessary .5
A dismal conclusion, not just for anarchists but for anybody who ever
wondered if there might be a viable alternative to the current status quo.
Still, the truly remarkable thing is that, despite the self-assured tone, such
pronouncements are not actually based on any kind of scientiﬁc evidence.
As we will soon be discovering, there is simply no reason to believe that
small-scale groups are especially likely to be egalitarian – or , conversely ,
that lar ge ones must necessarily have kings, presidents or even
bureaucracies. Statements like these are just so many prejudices dressed up
as facts, or even as laws of history .6
ON THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
As we say , it’s all just an endless repetition of a story ﬁrst told by Rousseau
in 1754. Many contemporary scholars will quite literally say thatRousseau’ s vision has been proved correct. If so, it is an extraordinary
coincidence, since Rousseau himself never suggested that the innocent State
of Nature really happened. On the contrary , he insisted he was engaging in a
thought experiment: ‘One must not take the kind of research which we enter
into as the pursuit of truths of history , but solely as hypothetical and
conditional reasonings, better ﬁtted to clarify the nature of things than to
expose their actual origin …’7
Rousseau’ s portrayal of the State of Nature and how it was overturned by
the coming of agriculture was never intended to form the basis for a series
of evolutionary stages, like the ones Scottish philosophers such as Smith,
Ferguson or Millar (and later on, Lewis Henry Morgan) were referring to
when they spoke of ‘Savagery’ and ‘Barbarism’. In no sense was Rousseau
imagining these dif ferent states of being as levels of social and moral
development, corresponding to historical changes in modes of production:
foraging, pastoralism, farming, industry . Rather , what Rousseau presented
was more of a parable, by way of an attempt to explore a fundamental
paradox of human politics: how is it that our innate drive for freedom
somehow leads us, time and again, on a ‘spontaneous march to inequality’?
8
Describing how the invention of farming ﬁrst leads to private property ,
and property to the need for civil government to protect it, this is how
Rousseau puts things: ‘All ran towards their chains, believing that they
were securing their liberty; for although they had reason enough to discern
the advantages of a civil order , they did not have experience enough to
foresee the dangers.’9 His imaginary State of Nature was primarily invoked
as a way of illustrating the point. T rue, he didn’ t invent the concept: as a
rhetorical device, the State of Nature had already been used in European
philosophy for a century . Widely deployed by natural law theorists, it
effectively allowed every thinker interested in the origins of government
(Locke, Grotius and so on) to play God, each coming up with his own
variant on humanity’ s original condition, as a springboard for speculation.
Hobbes was doing much the same thing when he wrote in Leviathan  that
the primordial state of human society would necessarily have been a
‘Bellum omnium contra omnes ’, a war of all against all, which could only
be overcome by the creation of an absolute sovereign power . He wasn’ t
saying there had actually been a time when everyone lived in such a
primordial state. Some suspect that Hobbes’ s state of war was really anallegory for his native England’ s descent into civil war in the mid
seventeenth century , which drove the royalist author into exile in Paris.
Whatever the case, the closest Hobbes himself came to suggesting this state
really existed was when he noted how the only people who weren’ t under
the ultimate authority of some king were the kings themselves, and they
always seemed to be at war with one another .
Despite all this, many modern writers treat Leviathan  in the same way
others treat Rousseau’ s Discourse  – as if it were laying the groundwork for
an evolutionary study of history; and although the two have completely
different starting points, the result is rather similar .10
‘When it came to violence in pre-state peoples,’ writes the psychologist
Steven Pinker , ‘Hobbes and Rousseau were talking through their hats:
neither knew a thing about life before civilization.’ On this point, Pinker is
absolutely right. In the same breath, however , he also asks us to believe that
Hobbes, writing in 1651 (apparently through his hat), somehow managed to
guess right, and come up with an analysis of violence and its causes in
human history that is ‘as good as any today’.1 1 This would be an
astonishing – not to mention damning – verdict on centuries of empirical
research, if it only happened to be true. As we’ll see, it is not even close.12
We can take Pinker as our quintessential modern Hobbesian. In his
magnum opus, The Better Angels of Our Natur e: Why V iolence Has
Declined  (2012), and subsequent books like Enlightenment Now: The Case
for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Pr ogress (2018) he ar gues that today
we live in a world which is, overall, far less violent and cruel than anything
our ancestors had ever experienced.13
Now , this may seem counter -intuitive to anyone who spends much time
watching the news, let alone who knows much about the history of the
twentieth century . Pinker , though, is conﬁdent that an objective statistical
analysis, shorn of sentiment, will show us to be living in an age of
unprecedented peace and security . And this, he suggests, is the logical
outcome of living in sovereign states, each with a monopoly over the
legitimate use of violence within its borders, as opposed to the ‘anarchic
societies’ (as he calls them) of our deep evolutionary past, where life for
most people was, indeed, typically ‘nasty , brutish, and short’.
Since, like Hobbes, Pinker is concerned with the origins of the state, his
key point of transition is not the rise of farming but the emer gence of cities.‘Archaeologists’, he writes, ‘tell us that humans lived in a state of anarchy
until the emer gence of civilization some ﬁve thousand years ago, when
sedentary farmers ﬁrst coalesced into cities and states and developed the
ﬁrst governments.’14 What follows is, to put it bluntly , a modern
psychologist making it up as he goes along. Y ou might hope that a
passionate advocate of science would approach the topic scientiﬁcally ,
through a broad appraisal of the evidence – but this is precisely the
approach to human prehistory that Pinker seems to ﬁnd uninteresting.
Instead he relies on anecdotes, images and individual sensational
discoveries, like the headline-making ﬁnd, in 1991, of ‘Ötzi the T yrolean
Iceman’.
‘What is it about the ancients,’ Pinker asks at one point, ‘that they
couldn’ t leave us an interesting corpse without resorting to foul play?’
There is an obvious response to this: doesn’ t it rather depend on which
corpse you consider interesting in the ﬁrst place? Y es, a little over 5,000
years ago someone walking through the Alps left the world of the living
with an arrow in his side; but there’ s no particular reason to treat Ötzi as a
poster child for humanity in its original condition, other than, perhaps, Ötzi
suiting Pinker ’s argument. But if all we’re doing is cherry-picking, we
could just as easily have chosen the much earlier burial known to
archaeologists as Romito 2 (after the Calabrian rock-shelter where it was
found). Let’ s take a moment to consider what it would mean if we did this.
Romito 2 is the 10,000-year -old burial of a male with a rare genetic
disorder (acromesomelic dysplasia): a severe type of dwarﬁsm, which in
life would have rendered him both anomalous in his community and unable
to participate in the kind of high-altitude hunting that was necessary for
their survival. Studies of his pathology show that, despite generally poor
levels of health and nutrition, that same community of hunter -gatherers still
took pains to support this individual through infancy and into early
adulthood, granting him the same share of meat as everyone else, and
ultimately according him a careful, sheltered burial.15
Neither is Romito 2 an isolated case. When archaeologists undertake
balanced appraisals of hunter -gatherer burials from the Palaeolithic, they
ﬁnd high frequencies of health-related disabilities – but also surprisingly
high levels of care until the time of death (and beyond, since some of these
funerals were remarkably lavish).16 If we did want to reach a general
conclusion about what form human societies originally took, based onstatistical frequencies of health indicators from ancient burials, we would
have to reach the exact opposite conclusion to Hobbes (and Pinker): in
origin, it might be claimed, our species is a nurturing and care-giving
species, and there was simply no need for life to be nasty , brutish or short.
We’re not suggesting we actually do this. As we’ll see, there is reason to
believe that during the Palaeolithic, only rather unusual individuals were
buried at all. W e just want to point out how easy it would be to play the
same game in the other direction – easy , but frankly not too enlightening.17
As we get to grips with the actual evidence, we always ﬁnd that the realities
of early human social life were far more complex, and a good deal more
interesting, than any modern-day State of Nature theorist would ever be
likely to guess.
When it comes to cherry-picking anthropological case studies, and putting
them forward as representative of our ‘contemporary ancestors’ – that is, as
models for what humans might have been like in a State of Nature – those
working in the tradition of Rousseau tend to prefer African foragers like the
Hadza, Pygmies or !Kung. Those who follow Hobbes prefer the Y anomami.
The Y anomami are an indigenous population who live lar gely by
growing plantains and cassava in the Amazon rainforest, their traditional
homeland, on the border of southern V enezuela and northern Brazil. Since
the 1970s, the Y anomami have acquired a reputation as the quintessential
violent savages: ‘ﬁerce people’, as their most famous ethnographer ,
Napoleon Chagnon, called them. This seems decidedly unfair to the
Yanomami since, in fact, statistics show they’re not particularly violent –
compared with other Amerindian groups, Y anomami homicide rates turn
out average-to-low .18 Again, though, actual statistics turn out to matter less
than the availability of dramatic images and anecdotes. The real reason the
Yanomami are so famous, and have such a colourful reputation, has
everything to do with Chagnon himself: his 1968 book Yanomamö: The
Fierce People , which sold millions of copies, and also a series of ﬁlms,
such as The Ax Fight , which of fered viewers a vivid glimpse of tribal
warfare. For a while all this made Chagnon the world’ s most famous
anthropologist, in the process turning the Y anomami into a notorious case
study of primitive violence and establishing their scientiﬁc importance in
the emer ging ﬁeld of sociobiology .We should be fair to Chagnon (not everyone is). He never claimed the
Yanomami should be treated as living remnants of the Stone Age; indeed,
he often noted that they obviously weren’ t. At the same time, and somewhat
unusually for an anthropologist, he tended to deﬁne them primarily in terms
of things they lacked (e.g. written language, a police force, a formal
judiciary), as opposed to the positive features of their culture, which has
rather the same ef fect of setting them up as quintessential primitives.19
Chagnon’ s central ar gument was that adult Y anomami men achieve both
cultural and reproductive advantages by killing other adult men; and that
this feedback between violence and biological ﬁtness – if generally
representative of the early human condition – might have had evolutionary
consequences for our species as a whole.20
This is not just a big ‘if ’ – it’ s enormous. Other anthropologists started
raining down questions, not always friendly .21 Allegations of professional
misconduct were levelled at Chagnon (mostly revolving around ethical
standards in the ﬁeld), and everyone took sides. Some of these accusations
appear baseless, but the rhetoric of Chagnon’ s defenders grew so heated
that (as another celebrated anthropologist, Clif ford Geertz, put it) not only
was he held up as the epitome of rigorous, scientiﬁc anthropology , but all
who questioned him or his social Darwinism were excoriated as ‘Marxists’,
‘liars’, ‘cultural anthropologists from the academic left’, ‘ayatollahs’ and
‘politically correct bleeding hearts’. T o this day , there is no easier way to
get anthropologists to begin denouncing each other as extremists than to
mention the name of Napoleon Chagnon.22
The important point here is that, as a ‘non-state’ people, the Y anomami
are supposed to exemplify what Pinker calls the ‘Hobbesian trap’, whereby
individuals in tribal societies ﬁnd themselves caught in repetitive cycles of
raiding and warfare, living fraught and precarious lives, always just a few
steps away from violent death on the tip of a sharp weapon or at the end of
a vengeful club. That, Pinker tells us, is the kind of dismal fate ordained for
us by evolution. W e have only escaped it by virtue of our willingness to
place ourselves under the common protection of nation states, courts of law
and police forces; and also by embracing virtues of reasoned debate and
self-control that Pinker sees as the exclusive heritage of a European
‘civilizing process’, which produced the Age of Enlightenment (in other
words, were it not for V oltaire, and the police, the knife-ﬁght over
Chagnon’ s ﬁndings would have been physical, not just academic).There are many problems with this ar gument. W e’ll start with the most
obvious. The idea that our current ideals of freedom, equality and
democracy are somehow products of the ‘W estern tradition’ would in fact
have come as an enormous surprise to someone like V oltaire. As we’ll soon
see, the Enlightenment thinkers who propounded such ideals almost
invariably put them in the mouths of foreigners, even ‘savages’ like the
Yanomami. This is hardly surprising, since it’ s almost impossible to ﬁnd a
single author in that W estern tradition, from Plato to Marcus Aurelius to
Erasmus, who did not make it clear that they would have been opposed to
such ideas. The word ‘democracy’ might have been invented in Europe
(barely , since Greece at the time was much closer culturally to North Africa
and the Middle East than it was to, say , England), but it’ s almost impossible
to ﬁnd a single European author before the nineteenth century who
suggested it would be anything other than a terrible form of government.23
For obvious reasons, Hobbes’ s position tends to be favoured by those on
the right of the political spectrum, and Rousseau’ s by those leaning left.
Pinker positions himself as a rational centrist, condemning what he
considers to be the extremists on either side. But why then insist that all
signiﬁcant forms of human progress before the twentieth century can be
attributed only to that one group of humans who used to refer to themselves
as ‘the white race’ (and now , generally , call themselves by its more
accepted synonym, ‘W estern civilization’)? There is simply no reason to
make this move. It would be just as easy (actually , rather easier) to identify
things that can be interpreted as the ﬁrst stirrings of rationalism, legality ,
deliberative democracy and so forth all over the world, and only then tell
the story of how they coalesced into the current global system.24
Insisting, to the contrary , that all good things come only from Europe
ensures one’ s work can be read as a retroactive apology for genocide, since
(apparently , for Pinker) the enslavement, rape, mass murder and destruction
of whole civilizations – visited on the rest of the world by European powers
– is just another example of humans comporting themselves as they always
had; it was in no sense unusual. What was really signiﬁcant, so this
argument goes, is that it made possible the dissemination of what he takes
to be ‘purely’ European notions of freedom, equality before the law , and
human rights to the survivors.
Whatever the unpleasantness of the past, Pinker assures us, there is every
reason to be optimistic, indeed happy , about the overall path our species hastaken. T rue, he does concede there is scope for some serious tinkering in
areas like poverty reduction, income inequality or indeed peace and
security; but on balance – and relative to the number of people living on
earth today – what we have now is a spectacular improvement on anything
our species accomplished in its history so far (unless you’re Black, or live
in Syria, for example). Modern life is, for Pinker , in almost every way
superior to what came before; and here he does produce elaborate statistics
which purport to show how every day in every way – health, security ,
education, comfort, and by almost any other conceivable parameter –
everything is actually getting better and better .
It’s hard to ar gue with the numbers, but as any statistician will tell you,
statistics are only as good as the premises on which they are based. Has
‘Western civilization’ really made life better for everyone? This ultimately
comes down to the question of how to measure human happiness, which is
a notoriously difﬁcult thing to do. About the only dependable way anyone
has ever discovered to determine whether one way of living is really more
satisfying, fulﬁlling, happy or otherwise preferable to any other is to allow
people to fully experience both, give them a choice, then watch what they
actually do. For instance, if Pinker is correct, then any sane person who had
to choose between (a) the violent chaos and abject poverty of the ‘tribal’
stage in human development and (b) the relative security and prosperity of
Western civilization would not hesitate to leap for safety .25
But empirical data is available here, and it suggests something is very
wrong with Pinker ’s conclusions.
Over the last several centuries, there have been numerous occasions when
individuals found themselves in a position to make precisely this choice –
and they almost never go the way Pinker would have predicted. Some have
left us clear , rational explanations for why they made the choices they did.
Let us consider the case of Helena V alero, a Brazilian woman born into a
family of Spanish descent, whom Pinker mentions as a ‘white girl’
abducted by Y anomami in 1932 while travelling with her parents along the
remote Rio Dimití.
For two decades, V alero lived with a series of Y anomami families,
marrying twice, and eventually achieving a position of some importance in
her community . Pinker brieﬂy cites the account V alero later gave of her own
life, where she describes the brutality of a Y anomami raid.26 What heneglects to mention is that in 1956 she abandoned the Y anomami to seek
her natal family and live again in ‘W estern civilization,’ only to ﬁnd herself
in a state of occasional hunger and constant dejection and loneliness. After
a while, given the ability to make a fully informed decision, Helena V alero
decided she preferred life among the Y anomami, and returned to live with
them.27
Her story is by no means unusual. The colonial history of North and
South America is full of accounts of settlers, captured or adopted by
indigenous societies, being given the choice of where they wished to stay
and almost invariably choosing to stay with the latter .28 This even applied
to abducted children. Confronted again with their biological parents, most
would run back to their adoptive kin for protection.29 By contrast,
Amerindians incorporated into European society by adoption or marriage,
including those who – unlike the unfortunate Helena V alero – enjoyed
considerable wealth and schooling, almost invariably did just the opposite:
either escaping at the earliest opportunity , or – having tried their best to
adjust, and ultimately failed – returning to indigenous society to live out
their last days.
Among the most eloquent commentaries on this whole phenomenon is to
be found in a private letter written by Benjamin Franklin to a friend:
When an Indian Child has been brought up among us, taught our
language and habituated to our Customs, yet if he goes to see his
relations and make one Indian Ramble with them there is no
persuading him ever to return, and that this is not natural merely as
Indians, but as men, is plain from this, that when white persons of
either sex have been taken prisoner young by the Indians, and lived
awhile among them, tho’ ransomed by their Friends, and treated
with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among
the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our
manner of life, and the care and pains that are necessary to support
it, and take the ﬁrst opportunity of escaping again into the W oods,
from whence there is no reclaiming them. One instance I remember
to have heard, where the person was to be brought home to possess
a good Estate; but ﬁnding some care necessary to keep it together ,
he relinquished it to a younger brother , reserving to himself nothingbut a gun and match-Coat, with which he took his way again to the
Wilderness.30
Many who found themselves embroiled in such contests of civilization, if
we may call them that, were able to of fer clear reasons for their decisions to
stay with their erstwhile captors. Some emphasized the virtues of freedom
they found in Native American societies, including sexual freedom, but also
freedom from the expectation of constant toil in pursuit of land and
wealth.31 Others noted the ‘Indian’ s’ reluctance ever to let anyone fall into
a condition of poverty , hunger or destitution. It was not so much that they
feared poverty themselves, but rather that they found life inﬁnitely more
pleasant in a society where no one else was in a position of abject misery
(perhaps much as Oscar W ilde declared he was an advocate of socialism
because he didn’ t like having to look at poor people or listen to their
stories). For anyone who has grown up in a city full of rough sleepers and
panhandlers – and that is, unfortunately , most of us – it is always a bit
startling to discover there’ s nothing inevitable about any of this.
Still others noted the ease with which outsiders, taken in by ‘Indian’
families, might achieve acceptance and prominent positions in their
adoptive communities, becoming members of chieﬂy households, or even
chiefs themselves.32 Western propagandists speak endlessly about equality
of opportunity; these seem to have been societies where it actually existed.
By far the most common reasons, however , had to do with the intensity of
social bonds they experienced in Native American communities: qualities
of mutual care, love and above all happiness, which they found impossible
to replicate once back in European settings. ‘Security’ takes many forms.
There is the security of knowing one has a statistically smaller chance of
getting shot with an arrow . And then there’ s the security of knowing that
there are people in the world who will care deeply if one is.
HOW THE CONVENTIONAL NARRA TIVE OF HUMAN
HIST ORY IS NOT ONL Y WRONG, BUT QUITE NEEDLESSL Y
DULL
One gets the sense that indigenous life was, to put it very crudely , just a lot
more interesting than life in a ‘W estern’ town or city , especially insofar as
the latter involved long hours of monotonous, repetitive, conceptuallyempty activity . The fact that we ﬁnd it hard to imagine how such an
alternative life could be endlessly engaging and interesting is perhaps more
a reﬂection on the limits of our imagination than on the life itself.
One of the most pernicious aspects of standard world-historical narratives
is precisely that they dry everything up, reduce people to cardboard
stereotypes, simplify the issues (are we inherently selﬁsh and violent, or
innately kind and co-operative?) in ways that themselves undermine,
possibly even destroy , our sense of human possibility . ‘Noble’ savages are,
ultimately , just as boring as savage ones; more to the point, neither actually
exist. Helena V alero was herself adamant on this point. The Y anomami
were not devils, she insisted, neither were they angels. They were human,
like the rest of us.
Now , we should be clear here: social theory always, necessarily , involves
a bit of simpliﬁcation. For instance, almost any human action might be said
to have a political aspect, an economic aspect, a psycho-sexual aspect and
so forth. Social theory is lar gely a game of make-believe in which we
pretend, just for the sake of ar gument, that there’ s just one thing going on:
essentially , we reduce everything to a cartoon so as to be able to detect
patterns that would be otherwise invisible. As a result, all real progress in
social science has been rooted in the courage to say things that are, in the
ﬁnal analysis, slightly ridiculous: the work of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud or
Claude Lévi-Strauss being only particularly salient cases in point. One must
simplify the world to discover something new about it. The problem comes
when, long after the discovery has been made, people continue to simplify .
Hobbes and Rousseau told their contemporaries things that were
startling, profound and opened new doors of the imagination. Now their
ideas are just tired common sense. There’ s nothing in them that justiﬁes the
continued simpliﬁcation of human af fairs. If social scientists today continue
to reduce past generations to simplistic, two-dimensional caricatures, it is
not so much to show us anything original, but just because they feel that’ s
what social scientists are expected to do so as to appear ‘scientiﬁc’. The
actual result is to impoverish history – and as a consequence, to impoverish
our sense of possibility . Let us end this introduction with an illustration,
before moving on to the heart of the matter .
Ever since Adam Smith, those trying to prove that contemporary forms of
competitive market exchange are rooted in human nature have pointed tothe existence of what they call ‘primitive trade’. Already tens of thousands
of years ago, one can ﬁnd evidence of objects – very often precious stones,
shells or other items of adornment – being moved around over enormous
distances. Often these were just the sort of objects that anthropologists
would later ﬁnd being used as ‘primitive currencies’ all over the world.
Surely this must prove capitalism in some form or another has always
existed?
The logic is perfectly circular . If precious objects were moving long
distances, this is evidence of ‘trade’ and, if trade occurred, it must have
taken some sort of commercial form; therefore, the fact that, say , 3,000
years ago Baltic amber found its way to the Mediterranean, or shells from
the Gulf of Mexico were transported to Ohio, is proof that we are in the
presence of some embryonic form of market economy . Markets are
universal. Therefore, there must have been a market. Therefore, markets are
universal. And so on.
All such authors are really saying is that they themselves cannot
personally imagine any other way that precious objects might move about.
But lack of imagination is not itself an ar gument. It’ s almost as if these
writers are afraid to suggest anything that seems original, or , if they do, feel
obliged to use vaguely scientiﬁc-sounding language (‘trans-regional
interaction spheres’, ‘multi-scalar networks of exchange’) to avoid having
to speculate about what precisely those things might be. In fact,
anthropology provides endless illustrations of how valuable objects might
travel long distances in the absence of anything that remotely resembles a
market economy .
The founding text of twentieth-century ethnography , Bronisław
Malinowski’ s 1922 Argonauts of the W estern Paciﬁc , describes how in the
‘kula chain’ of the Massim Islands of f Papua New Guinea, men would
undertake daring expeditions across dangerous seas in outrigger canoes, just
in order to exchange precious heirloom arm-shells and necklaces for each
other (each of the most important ones has its own name, and history of
former owners) – only to hold it brieﬂy , then pass it on again to a dif ferent
expedition from another island. Heirloom treasures circle the island chain
eternally , crossing hundreds of miles of ocean, arm-shells and necklaces in
opposite directions. T o an outsider , it seems senseless. T o the men of the
Massim it was the ultimate adventure, and nothing could be more important
than to spread one’ s name, in this fashion, to places one had never seen.Is this ‘trade’? Perhaps, but it would bend to breaking point our ordinary
understandings of what that word means. There is, in fact, a substantial
ethnographic literature on how such long-distance exchange operates in
societies without markets. Barter does occur: dif ferent groups may take on
specialities – one is famous for its feather -work, another provides salt, in a
third all women are potters – to acquire things they cannot produce
themselves; sometimes one group will specialize in the very business of
moving people and things around. But we often ﬁnd such regional networks
developing lar gely for the sake of creating friendly mutual relations, or
having an excuse to visit one another from time to time;33 and there are
plenty of other possibilities that in no way resemble ‘trade’.
Let’s list just a few , all drawn from North American material, to give the
reader a taste of what might really be going on when people speak of ‘long-
distance interaction spheres’ in the human past:
1. Dreams or vision quests : among Iroquoian-speaking peoples in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was considered extremely
important literally to realize one’ s dreams. Many European observers
marvelled at how Indians would be willing to travel for days to bring
back some object, trophy , crystal or even an animal like a dog that they
had dreamed of acquiring. Anyone who dreamed about a neighbour or
relative’ s possession (a kettle, ornament, mask and so on) could
normally demand it; as a result, such objects would often gradually
travel some way from town to town. On the Great Plains, decisions to
travel long distances in search of rare or exotic items could form part
of vision quests.34
2. Travelling healers and entertainers : in 1528, when a shipwrecked
Spaniard named Álvar Núñez Cabeza de V aca made his way from
Florida across what is now T exas to Mexico, he found he could pass
easily between villages (even villages at war with one another) by
offering his services as a magician and curer . Curers in much of North
America were also entertainers, and would often develop signiﬁcant
entourages; those who felt their lives had been saved by the
performance would, typically , offer up all their material possessions to
be divided among the troupe.35 By such means, precious objects could
easily travel very long distances.3. Women’ s gambling : women in many indigenous North American
societies were inveterate gamblers; the women of adjacent villages
would often meet to play dice or a game played with a bowl and plum
stone, and would typically bet their shell beads or other objects of
personal adornment as the stakes. One archaeologist versed in the
ethnographic literature, W arren DeBoer , estimates that many of the
shells and other exotica discovered in sites halfway across the
continent had got there by being endlessly wagered, and lost, in inter -
village games of this sort, over very long periods of time.36
We could multiply examples, but assume that by now the reader gets the
broader point we are making. When we simply guess as to what humans in
other times and places might be up to, we almost invariably make guesses
that are far less interesting, far less quirky – in a word, far less human than
what was likely going on.
ON WHA T’S T O FOLLOW
In this book we will not only be presenting a new history of humankind, but
inviting the reader into a new science of history , one that restores our
ancestors to their full humanity . Rather than asking how we ended up
unequal, we will start by asking how it was that ‘inequality’ became such
an issue to begin with, then gradually build up an alternative narrative that
corresponds more closely to our current state of knowledge. If humans did
not spend 95 per cent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter -
gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did
not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what did they
imply? What was really happening in those periods we usually see as
marking the emer gence of ‘the state’? The answers are often unexpected,
and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and
more full of playful possibilities, than we tend to assume.
In one sense, then, this book is simply trying to lay down foundations for
a new world history , rather as Gordon Childe did when, back in the 1930s,
he invented phrases like ‘the Neolithic Revolution’ or ‘the Urban
Revolution’. As such it is necessarily uneven and incomplete. At the same
time, this book is also something else: a quest to discover the right
questions. If ‘what is the origin of inequality?’ is not the biggest questionwe should be asking about history , what then should it be? As the stories of
one-time captives escaping back to the woods again make clear , Rousseau
was not entirely mistaken. Something has been lost. He just had a rather
idiosyncratic (and ultimately , false) notion of what it was. How do we
characterize it, then? And how lost is it really? What does it imply about
possibilities for social change today?
For about a decade now , we – that is, the two authors of this book – have
been engaged in a prolonged conversation with each other about exactly
these questions. This is the reason for the book’ s somewhat unusual
structure, which begins by tracing the historical roots of the question (‘what
is the origin of social inequality?’) back to a series of encounters between
European colonists and Native American intellectuals in the seventeenth
century . The impact of those encounters upon what we now term the
Enlightenment, and indeed our basic conceptions of human history , is both
more subtle and profound than we usually care to admit. Revisiting them, as
we discovered, has startling implications for how we make sense of the
human past today , including the origins of farming, property , cities,
democracy , slavery and civilization itself. In the end, we decided to write a
book that would echo, to some degree at least, that evolution in our own
thought. In those conversations, the real breakthrough moment came when
we decided to move away from European thinkers like Rousseau entirely ,
and instead consider perspectives that derive from those indigenous thinkers
who ultimately inspired them.
So let us begin right there.2
Wicked Liberty
The indigenous critique and the myth of pr ogress
Jean-Jacques Rousseau left us a story about the origins of social inequality
that continues to be told and retold, in endless variations, to this day . It is
the story of humanity’ s original innocence, and unwitting departure from a
state of pristine simplicity on a voyage of technological discovery that
would ultimately guarantee both our ‘complexity’ and our enslavement.
How did this ambivalent story of civilization come about?
Intellectual historians have never really abandoned the Great Man theory
of history . They often write as if all important ideas in a given age can be
traced back to one or other extraordinary individual – whether Plato,
Confucius, Adam Smith or Karl Marx – rather than seeing such authors’
writings as particularly brilliant interventions in debates that were already
going on in taverns or dinner parties or public gardens (or , for that matter ,
lecture rooms), but which otherwise might never have been written down.
It’s a bit like pretending W illiam Shakespeare had somehow invented the
English language. In fact, many of Shakespeare’ s most brilliant turns of
phrase turn out to have been common expressions of the day , which any
Elizabethan Englishman or woman would be likely to have thrown into
casual conversation, and whose authors remain as obscure as those of
knock-knock jokes – even if, were it not for Shakespeare, they’d probably
have passed out of use and been for gotten long ago.
All this applies to Rousseau. Intellectual historians sometimes write as if
Rousseau had personally kicked of f the debate about social inequality with
his 1754 Discourse on the Origin and the Foundation of Inequality Among
Mankind . In fact, he wrote it to submit to an essay contest on the subject.IN WHICH WE SHOW HOW CRITIQUES OF EUROCENTRISM
CAN BACKFIRE, AND END UP TURNING ABORIGINAL
THINKERS INT O ‘SOCK-PUPPETS’
In March 1754, the learned society known as the Académie des Sciences,
Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon announced a national essay competition on
the question: ‘what is the origin of inequality  among men, and is it
authorized by natural law?’ What we’d like to do in this chapter is ask: why
is it that a group of scholars in Ancien Régime  France, hosting a national
essay contest, would have felt this was an appropriate question in the ﬁrst
place? The way the question is put, after all, assumes that social inequality
did have  an origin; that is, it takes for granted that there was a time when
human beings were equals – and that something then happened to change
this situation.
That is actually quite a startling thing for people living under an
absolutist monarchy like that of Louis XV to think. After all, it’ s not as if
anyone in France at that time had much personal experience of living in a
society of equals. This was a culture in which almost every aspect of human
interaction – whether eating, drinking, working or socializing – was marked
by elaborate pecking orders and rituals of social deference. The authors
who submitted their essays to this competition were men who spent their
lives having all their needs attended to by servants. They lived of f the
patronage of dukes and archbishops, and rarely entered a building without
knowing the precise order of importance of everyone inside. Rousseau was
one such man: an ambitious young philosopher , he was at the time engaged
in an elaborate project of trying to sleep his way into inﬂuence at court. The
closest he’d likely ever come to experiencing social equality himself was
someone doling out equal slices of cake at a dinner party . Yet everyone at
the time also agreed that this situation was somehow unnatural; that it had
not always been that way .
If we want to understand why that was, we need to look not only at
France, but also at France’ s place in a much lar ger world.
Fascination with the question of social inequality was relatively new in the
1700s, and it had everything to do with the shock and confusion that
followed Europe’ s sudden integration into a global economy , where it had
long been a very minor player .In the Middle Ages, most people in other parts of the world who actually
knew anything about northern Europe at all considered it an obscure and
uninviting backwater full of religious fanatics who, aside from occasional
attacks on their neighbours (‘the Crusades’), were lar gely irrelevant to
global trade and world politics.1 European intellectuals of that time were
just rediscovering Aristotle and the ancient world, and had very little idea
what people were thinking and ar guing about anywhere else. All this
changed, of course, in the late ﬁfteenth century , when Portuguese ﬂeets
began rounding Africa and bursting into the Indian Ocean – and especially
with the Spanish conquest of the Americas. Suddenly , a few of the more
powerful European kingdoms found themselves in control of vast stretches
of the globe, and European intellectuals found themselves exposed, not only
to the civilizations of China and India but to a whole plethora of previously
unimagined social, scientiﬁc and political ideas. The ultimate result of this
ﬂood of new ideas came to be known as the ‘Enlightenment’.
Of course, this isn’ t usually the way historians of ideas tell this story . Not
only are we taught to think of intellectual history as something lar gely
produced by individuals writing great books or thinking great thoughts, but
these ‘great thinkers’ are assumed to perform both these activities almost
exclusively with reference to each other . As a result, even in cases where
Enlightenment thinkers openly insisted they were getting their ideas from
foreign sources (as the German philosopher Gottfried W ilhelm Leibniz did
when he ur ged his compatriots to adopt Chinese models of statecraft),
there’ s a tendency for contemporary historians to insist they weren’ t really
serious; or else that when they said they were embracing Chinese, or
Persian, or indigenous American ideas these weren’ t really Chinese, Persian
or indigenous American ideas at all but ones they themselves had made up
and merely attributed to exotic Others.2
These are remarkably arrogant assumptions – as if ‘W estern thought’ (as
it later came to be known) was such a powerful and monolithic body of
ideas that no one else could possibly have any meaningful inﬂuence on it.
It’s also pretty obviously untrue. Just consider the case of Leibniz: over the
course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, European governments
gradually came to adopt the idea that every government should properly
preside over a population of lar gely uniform language and culture, run by a
bureaucratic ofﬁcialdom trained in the liberal arts whose members had
succeeded in passing competitive exams. It might seem surprising that theydid so, since nothing remotely like that had existed in any previous period
of European history . Yet it was almost exactly the system that had existed
for centuries in China.
Are we really to insist that the advocacy of Chinese models of statecraft
by Leibniz, his allies and followers really had nothing  to do with the fact
that Europeans did, in fact, adopt something that looks very much like
Chinese models of statecraft? What is really unusual about this case is that
Leibniz was so honest about his intellectual inﬂuences. When he lived,
Church authorities still wielded a great deal of power in most of Europe:
anyone making an ar gument that non-Christian ways were in any way
superior might ﬁnd themselves facing char ges of atheism, which was
potentially a capital of fence.3
It is much the same with the question of inequality . If we ask, not ‘what
are the origins of social inequality?’ but ‘what are the origins of the
question  about the origins of social inequality?’ (in other words, how did it
come about that, in 1754, the Académie de Dijon would think this an
appropriate question to ask?), then we are immediately confronted with a
long history of Europeans ar guing with one another about the nature of
faraway societies: in this case, particularly in the Eastern W oodlands of
North America. What’ s more, a lot of those conversations make reference to
arguments that took place between Europeans and indigenous Americans
about the nature of freedom, equality or for that matter rationality and
revealed religion – indeed, most of the themes that would later become
central to Enlightenment political thought.
Many inﬂuential Enlightenment thinkers did in fact claim that some of
their ideas on the subject were directly taken from Native American sources
– even though, predictably , intellectual historians today insist this cannot
really be the case. Indigenous people are assumed to have lived in a
completely dif ferent universe, inhabited a dif ferent reality , even; anything
Europeans said about them was simply a shadow-play projection, fantasies
of the ‘noble savage’ culled from the European tradition itself.4
Of course, such historians typically frame this position as a critique of
Western arrogance (‘how can you suggest that genocidal imperialists were
actually listening to those whose societies they were in the process of
stamping out?’), but it could equally well be seen as a form of W estern
arrogance in its own right. There is no contesting that European traders,
missionaries and settlers did actually engage in prolonged conversationswith people they encountered in what they called the New W orld, and often
lived among them for extended periods of time – even as they also colluded
in their destruction. W e also know that many of those living in Europe who
came to embrace principles of freedom and equality (principles barely
existing in their countries a few generations before) claimed that accounts
of these encounters had a profound inﬂuence on their thinking. T o deny any
possibility that they were right is, ef fectively , to insist that indigenous
people could not possibly have any real impact on history . It is, in fact, a
way of infantilizing non-W esterners: a practice denounced by these very
same authors.
In recent years, a growing number of American scholars, most
themselves of indigenous descent, have challenged these assumptions.5
Here we follow in their footsteps. Basically , we are going to retell the story ,
starting from the assumption that all parties to the conversation between
European colonists and their indigenous interlocutors were adults, and that,
at least occasionally , they actually listened to each other . If we do this, even
familiar histories suddenly begin to look very dif ferent. In fact, what we’ll
see is not only that indigenous Americans – confronted with strange
foreigners – gradually developed their own, surprisingly consistent critique
of European institutions, but that these critiques came to be taken very
seriously in Europe itself.
Just how seriously can hardly be overstated. For European audiences, the
indigenous critique would come as a shock to the system, revealing
possibilities for human emancipation that, once disclosed, could hardly be
ignored. Indeed, the ideas expressed in that critique came to be perceived as
such a menace to the fabric of European society that an entire body of
theory was called into being, speciﬁcally to refute them. As we will shortly
see, the whole story we summarized in the last chapter – our standard
historical meta-narrative about the ambivalent progress of human
civilization, where freedoms are lost as societies grow bigger and more
complex – was invented lar gely for the purpose of neutralizing the threat of
indigenous critique.
The ﬁrst thing to emphasize is that ‘the origin of social inequality’ is not a
problem which would have made sense to anyone in the Middle Ages.
Ranks and hierarchies were assumed to have existed from the very
beginning. Even in the Garden of Eden, as the thirteenth-centuryphilosopher Thomas Aquinas observed, Adam clearly outranked Eve.
‘Social equality’ – and therefore, its opposite, inequality – simply did not
exist as a concept. A recent survey of medieval literature by two Italian
scholars in fact ﬁnds no evidence that the Latin terms aequalitas  or
inaequalitas  or their English, French, Spanish, German and Italian cognates
were used to describe social relations at all before the time of Columbus. So
one cannot even say that medieval thinkers rejected the notion of social
equality: the idea that it might exist seems never to have occurred to them.6
In fact, the terms ‘equality’ and ‘inequality’ only began to enter common
currency in the early seventeenth century , under the inﬂuence of natural law
theory . And natural law theory , in turn, arose lar gely in the course of
debates about the moral and legal implications of Europe’ s discoveries in
the New W orld.
It’s important to remember that Spanish adventurers like Cortés and
Pizarro carried out their conquests lar gely without authorization from
higher authorities; afterwards, there were intense debates back home over
whether such unvarnished aggression against people who, after all, posed
no threat to Europeans could really be justiﬁed.7 The key problem was that
– unlike non-Christians of the Old W orld, who could be assumed to have
had the opportunity to learn the teachings of Jesus, and therefore to have
actively rejected them – it was fairly obvious that the inhabitants of the
New W orld simply never had any exposure to Christian ideas. So they
couldn’ t be classed as inﬁdels.
The conquistadors generally ﬁnessed this question by reading a
declaration in Latin calling on all the Indians to convert before attacking
them. Legal scholars in universities like Salamanca in Spain were not
impressed by this expedient. At the same time, attempts to write of f the
inhabitants of the Americas as so utterly alien that they fell outside the
bounds of humanity entirely , and could be treated literally like animals, also
didn’ t ﬁnd much purchase. Even cannibals, the jurists noted, had
governments, societies and laws, and were able to construct ar guments to
defend the justice of their (cannibalistic) social arrangements; therefore they
were clearly humans, vested by God with powers of reason.
The legal and philosophical question then became: what rights do human
beings have simply by dint of being human – that is, what rights could they
be said to have ‘naturally’, even if they existed in a State of Nature,
innocent of the teachings of written philosophy and revealed religion, andwithout codiﬁed laws? The matter was hotly debated. W e need not linger
here on the exact formulae that natural law theorists came up with (sufﬁce
to say , they did allow that Americans had natural rights, but ended up
justifying their conquest anyway , provided their subsequent treatment was
not too violent or oppressive), but what is important, in this context, is that
they opened a conceptual door . Writers like Thomas Hobbes, Hugo Grotius
or John Locke could skip past the biblical narratives everyone used to start
with, and begin instead with a question such as: what might humans have
been like in a State of Nature, when all they had was their humanity?
Each of these authors populated the State of Nature with what they took
to be the simplest societies known in the W estern Hemisphere, and thus
they concluded that the original state of humanity was one of freedom and
equality , for better or worse (Hobbes, for example, deﬁnitely felt it was
worse). It’ s important to stop here for a moment and consider why they
came to this verdict – because it was by no means an obvious or inevitable
conclusion.
First of all, while it may seem obvious to us, the fact that natural law
theorists in the seventeenth century ﬁxed on apparently simple societies as
exemplars of primordial times – societies like the Algonkians of North
America’ s Eastern W oodlands, or the Caribs and Amazonians, rather than
urban civilizations like the Aztecs or Inca – would not have seemed obvious
at the time.
Earlier authors, confronted by a population of forest dwellers with no
king and employing only stone tools, were unlikely to have seen them as in
any way primordial. Sixteenth-century scholars, such as the Spanish
missionary José de Acosta, were more likely to conclude they were looking
at the fallen vestiges of some ancient civilization, or refugees who had, in
the course of their wanderings, for gotten the arts of metallur gy and civil
governance. Such a conclusion would have made obvious common sense
for people who assumed that all truly important knowledge had been
revealed by God at the beginning of time, that cities had existed before the
Flood, and that saw their own intellectual life lar gely as attempts to recover
the lost wisdom of ancient Greeks and Romans.
History , in Renaissance Europe of the ﬁfteenth to sixteenth centuries, was
not a story of progress. It was lar gely a series of disasters. Introducing the
concept of a State of Nature didn’ t exactly ﬂip all this around, at least notimmediately , but it did allow political philosophers after the seventeenth
century to imagine people without the trappings of civilization as something
other than degenerate savages; as a kind of humanity ‘in the raw’. And this,
in turn, allowed them to ask a host of new questions about what it meant to
be human. What social forms would still exist, even among people who had
no recognizable form of law or government? W ould marriage exist? What
forms might it take? W ould Natural Man tend to be naturally gregarious, or
would people tend to avoid one another? W as there such a thing as natural
religion?
But the question still remains: why is it that by the eighteenth century ,
European intellectuals had come to ﬁx on the idea of primordial freedom or ,
especially , equality , to such an extent that it seemed perfectly natural to ask
a question like ‘what is the origin of inequality  among men?’ This seems
particularly odd considering how , prior to that time, most did not even
consider social equality possible.
First of all, a qualiﬁcation is in order . A certain folk egalitarianism
already existed in the Middle Ages, coming to the fore during popular
festivals like carnival, May Day or Christmas, when much of society
revelled in the idea of a ‘world turned upside down’, where all powers and
authorities were knocked to the ground or made a mockery of. Often the
celebrations were framed as a return to some primordial ‘age of equality’ –
the Age of Cronus, or Saturn, or the land of Cockaygne. Sometimes, too,
these ideals were invoked in popular revolts.
True, it’ s never entirely clear how far such egalitarian ideals are merely a
side ef fect of hierarchical social arrangements that obtained at ordinary
times. Our notion that everyone is equal before the law , for instance,
originally traces back to the idea that everyone is equal before the king, or
emperor: since if one man is invested with absolute power , then obviously
everyone else is equal in comparison. Early Christianity similarly insisted
that all believers were (in some ultimate sense) equal in relation to God,
whom they referred to as ‘the Lord’. As this illustrates, the overarching
power under which ordinary mortals are all de facto equals need not be a
real ﬂesh-and-blood human; one of the whole points of creating a ‘carnival
king’ or ‘May queen’ is that they exist in order to be dethroned.8
Europeans educated in classical literature would also have been familiar
with speculation about long-ago, happy , egalitarian orders that appear in
Greco-Roman sources; and notions of equality , at least among Christiannations, were to be found in the concept of res publica , or commonwealth,
which again looked to ancient precedents. All this is only to say that a state
of equality was not utterly inconceivable to European intellectuals before
the eighteenth century . None of it, however , explains why they came almost
universally to assume that human beings, innocent of civilization, would
ever exist in such a state. T rue, there were classical precedents for such
ideas, but there were classical precedents for the opposite as well.9 For
answers, we must return to ar guments deployed to establish that the
inhabitants of the Americas were fellow humans to begin with: to assert
that, however exotic or even perverse their customs might seem, Native
Americans were capable of making logical ar guments in their own defence.
What we’re going to suggest is that American intellectuals – we are using
the term ‘American’ as it was used at the time, to refer to indigenous
inhabitants of the W estern Hemisphere; and ‘intellectual’ to refer to anyone
in the habit of ar guing about abstract ideas – actually played a role in this
conceptual revolution. It is very strange that this should be considered a
particularly radical idea, but among mainstream intellectual historians today
it is almost a heresy .
What makes this especially odd is that no one denies that many European
explorers, missionaries, traders, settlers and others who sojourned on
American shores spent years learning native languages and perfecting their
skills in conversation with native speakers; just as indigenous Americans
did the work of learning Spanish, English, Dutch or French. Neither , we
think, would anyone who has ever learned a truly alien language deny that
doing so takes a great deal of imaginative work, trying to grasp unfamiliar
concepts. W e also know that missionaries typically conducted long
philosophical debates as part of their professional duties; many others, on
both sides, ar gued with one another either out of simple curiosity , or
because they had immediate practical reasons to understand the other ’s
point of view . Finally , no one would deny that travel literature, and
missionary relations – which often contained summaries of, or even extracts
from, these exchanges – were popular literary genres, avidly followed by
educated Europeans. Any middle-class household in eighteenth-century
Amsterdam or Grenoble would have been likely to have on its shelves at the
very least a copy of the Jesuit Relations of New France  (as France’ s North
American colonies were then known), and one or two accounts written byvoyagers to faraway lands. Such books were appreciated lar gely because
they contained surprising and unprecedented ideas.10
Historians are aware of all this. Y et the overwhelming majority still
conclude that even when European authors explicitly say they are
borrowing ideas, concepts and ar guments from indigenous thinkers, one
should not take them seriously . It’s all just supposed to be some kind of
misunderstanding, fabrication, or at best a naive projection of pre-existing
European ideas. American intellectuals, when they appear in European
accounts, are assumed to be mere representatives of some W estern
archetype of the ‘noble savage’ or sock-puppets, used as plausible alibis to
an author who might otherwise get into trouble for presenting subversive
ideas (deism, for example, or rational materialism, or unconventional views
on marriage).1 1
Certainly , if one encounters an ar gument ascribed to a ‘savage’ in a
European text that even remotely resembles anything to be found in Cicero
or Erasmus, one is automatically supposed to assume that no ‘savage’ could
possibly have really said it – or even that the conversation in question never
really took place at all.12 If nothing else, this habit of thought is very
convenient for students of W estern literature, themselves trained in Cicero
and Erasmus, who might otherwise be forced to actually try to learn
something about what indigenous people thought about the world, and
above all what they made of Europeans.
We intend to proceed in the opposite direction.
We will examine early missionary and travel accounts from New France
– especially the Great Lakes region – since these were the accounts
Rousseau himself was most familiar with, to get a sense of what its
indigenous inhabitants did actually think of French society , and how they
came to think of their own societies dif ferently as a result. W e will ar gue
that indigenous Americans did indeed develop a very strong critical view of
their invaders’ institutions: a view which focused ﬁrst on these institutions’
lack of freedom, and only later , as they became more familiar with
European social arrangements, on equality .
One of the reasons that missionary and travel literature became so
popular in Europe was precisely because it exposed its readers to this kind
of criticism, along with providing a sense of social possibility: the
knowledge that familiar ways were not the only ways, since – as these
books showed – there were clearly societies in existence that did thingsvery dif ferently . We will suggest that there is a reason why so many key
Enlightenment thinkers insisted that their ideals of individual liberty and
political equality were inspired by Native American sources and examples.
Because it was true.
IN WHICH WE CONSIDER WHA T THE INHABIT ANTS OF NEW
FRANCE MADE OF THEIR EUROPEAN INV ADERS,
ESPECIALL Y IN MA TTERS OF GENEROSITY , SOCIABILITY ,
MATERIAL WEAL TH, CRIME, PUNISHMENT AND LIBER TY
The ‘Age of Reason’ was an age of debate. The Enlightenment was rooted
in conversation; it took place lar gely in cafés and salons. Many classic
Enlightenment texts took the form of dialogues; most cultivated an easy ,
transparent, conversational style clearly inspired by the salon. (It was the
Germans, back then, who tended to write in the obscure style for which
French intellectuals have since become famous.) Appeal to ‘reason’ was
above all a style of ar gument. The ideals of the French Revolution – liberty ,
equality and fraternity – took the form they did in the course of just such a
long series of debates and conversations. All we’re going to suggest here is
that those conversations stretched back further than Enlightenment
historians assume.
Let’s begin by asking: what did the inhabitants of New France make of
the Europeans who began to arrive on their shores in the sixteenth century?
At that time, the region that came to be known as New France was
inhabited lar gely by speakers of Montagnais-Naskapi, Algonkian and
Iroquoian languages. Those closer to the coast were ﬁshers, foresters and
hunters, though most also practised horticulture; the W endat (Huron),13
concentrated in major river valleys further inland, growing maize, squash
and beans around fortiﬁed towns. Interestingly , early French observers
attached little importance to such economic distinctions, especially since
foraging or farming was, in either case, lar gely women’ s work. The men,
they noted, were primarily occupied in hunting and, occasionally , war ,
which meant they could in a sense be considered natural aristocrats. The
idea of the ‘noble savage’ can be traced back to such estimations.
Originally , it didn’ t refer to nobility of character but simply to the fact that
the Indian men concerned themselves with hunting and ﬁghting, which back
at home were lar gely the business of noblemen.But if French assessments of the character of ‘savages’ tended to be
decidedly mixed, the indigenous assessment of French character was
distinctly less so. Father Pierre Biard, for example, was a former theology
professor assigned in 1608 to evangelize the Algonkian-speaking Mi’kmaq
in Nova Scotia, who had lived for some time next to a French fort. Biard
did not think much of the Mi’kmaq, but reported that the feeling was
mutual: ‘They consider themselves better than the French: “For ,” they say ,
“you are always ﬁghting and quarrelling among yourselves; we live
peaceably . You are envious and are all the time slandering each other; you
are thieves and deceivers; you are covetous, and are neither generous nor
kind; as for us, if we have a morsel of bread we share it with our
neighbour .” They are saying these and like things continually .’14 What
seemed to irritate Biard the most was that the Mi’kmaq would constantly
assert that they were, as a result, ‘richer ’ than the French. The French had
more material possessions, the Mi’kmaq conceded; but they had other ,
greater assets: ease, comfort and time.
Twenty years later Brother Gabriel Sagard, a Recollect Friar ,15 wrote
similar things of the W endat nation. Sagard was at ﬁrst highly critical of
Wendat life, which he described as inherently sinful (he was obsessed with
the idea that W endat women were all intent on seducing him), but by the
end of his sojourn he had come to the conclusion their social arrangements
were in many ways superior to those at home in France. In the following
passages he was clearly echoing W endat opinion: ‘They have no lawsuits
and take little pains to acquire the goods of this life, for which we
Christians torment ourselves so much, and for our excessive and insatiable
greed in acquiring them we are justly and with reason reproved by their
quiet life and tranquil dispositions.’16 Much like Biard’ s Mi’kmaq, the
Wendat were particularly of fended by the French lack of generosity to one
another: ‘They reciprocate hospitality and give such assistance to one
another that the necessities of all are provided for without there being any
indigent beggar in their towns and villages; and they considered it a very
bad thing when they heard it said that there were in France a great many of
these needy beggars, and thought that this was for lack of charity in us, and
blamed us for it severely .’17
Wendat cast a similarly jaundiced eye at French habits of conversation.
Sagard was surprised and impressed by his hosts’ eloquence and powers of
reasoned ar gument, skills honed by near -daily public discussions ofcommunal af fairs; his hosts, in contrast, when they did get to see a group of
Frenchmen gathered together , often remarked on the way they seemed to be
constantly scrambling over each other and cutting each other of f in
conversation, employing weak ar guments, and overall (or so the subtext
seemed to be) not showing themselves to be particularly bright. People who
tried to grab the stage, denying others the means to present their ar guments,
were acting in much the same way as those who grabbed the material means
of subsistence and refused to share it; it is hard to avoid the impression that
Americans saw the French as existing in a kind of Hobbesian state of ‘war
of all against all’. (It’ s probably worthy of remark that especially in this
early contact period, Americans were likely to have known Europeans
largely through missionaries, trappers, merchants and soldiers – that is,
groups almost entirely composed of men. There were at ﬁrst very few
French women in the colonies, and fewer children. This probably had the
effect of making the competitiveness and lack of mutual care among them
seem all the more extreme.)
Sagard’ s account of his stay among the W endat became an inﬂuential
bestseller in France and across Europe: both Locke and V oltaire cited Le
grand voyage du pays des Hur ons as a principal source for their
descriptions of American societies. The multi-authored and much more
extensive Jesuit Relations , which appeared between 1633 and 1673, were
also widely read and debated in Europe, and include many a similar
remonstrance aimed at the French by W endat observers. One of the most
striking things about these seventy-one volumes of missionary ﬁeld reports
is that neither the Americans, nor their French interlocutors, appear to have
had very much to say about ‘equality’ per se – for example, the words égal
or égalité  barely appear , and on those very few occasions when they do it’ s
almost always in reference to ‘equality of the sexes’ (something the Jesuits
found particularly scandalous).
This appears to be the case, irrespective of whether the Jesuits in question
were ar guing with the W endat – who might not seem egalitarian in
anthropological terms, since they had formal political ofﬁces and a stratum
of war captives whom the Jesuits, at least, referred to as ‘slaves’ – or the
Mi’kmaq or Montagnais-Naskapi, who were or ganized into what later
anthropologists would consider egalitarian bands of hunter -gatherers.
Instead, we hear a multiplicity of American voices complaining about thecompetitiveness and selﬁshness of the French – and even more, perhaps,
about their hostility to freedom.
That indigenous Americans lived in generally free societies, and that
Europeans did not, was never really a matter of debate in these exchanges:
both sides agreed this was the case. What they dif fered on was whether or
not individual liberty was desirable.
This is one area in which early missionary or travellers’ accounts of the
Americas pose a genuine conceptual challenge to most readers today . Most
of us simply take it for granted that ‘W estern’ observers, even seventeenth-
century ones, are simply an earlier version of ourselves; unlike indigenous
Americans, who represent an essentially alien, perhaps even unknowable
Other . But in fact, in many ways, the authors of these texts were nothing
like us. When it came to questions of personal freedom, the equality of men
and women, sexual mores or popular sovereignty – or even, for that matter ,
theories of depth psychology18 – indigenous American attitudes are likely
to be far closer to the reader ’s own than seventeenth-century European
ones.
These dif fering views on individual liberty are especially striking.
Nowadays, it’ s almost impossible for anyone living in a liberal democracy
to say they are against freedom – at least in the abstract (in practice, of
course, our ideas are usually much more nuanced). This is one of the lasting
legacies of the Enlightenment and of the American and French Revolutions.
Personal freedom, we tend to believe, is inherently good (even if some of us
also feel that a society based on total individual liberty – one which took it
so far as to eliminate police, prisons or any sort of apparatus of coercion –
would instantly collapse into violent chaos). Seventeenth-century Jesuits
most certainly did not share this assumption. They tended to view
individual liberty as animalistic. In 1642, the Jesuit missionary Le Jeune
wrote of the Montagnais-Naskapi:
They imagine that they ought by right of birth, to enjoy the liberty
of wild ass colts, rendering no homage to any one whomsoever ,
except when they like. They have reproached me a hundred times
because we fear our Captains, while they laugh at and make sport of
theirs. All the authority of their chief is in his tongue’ s end; for he is
powerful in so far as he is eloquent; and, even if he kills himselftalking and haranguing, he will not be obeyed unless he pleases the
Savages.19
In the considered opinion of the Montagnais-Naskapi, however , the French
were little better than slaves, living in constant terror of their superiors.
Such criticism appears regularly in Jesuit accounts; what’ s more, it comes
not just from those who lived in nomadic bands, but equally from townsfolk
like the W endat. The missionaries, moreover , were willing to concede that
this wasn’ t all just rhetoric on the Americans’ part. Even W endat statesmen
couldn’ t compel anyone to do anything they didn’ t wish to do. As Father
Lallemant, whose correspondence provided an initial model for The Jesuit
Relations , noted of the W endat in 1644:
I do not believe that there is any people on earth freer than they , and
less able to allow the subjection of their wills to any power whatever
– so much so that Fathers here have no control over their children,
or Captains over their subjects, or the Laws of the country over any
of them, except in so far as each is pleased to submit to them. There
is no punishment which is inﬂicted on the guilty , and no criminal
who is not sure that his life and property are in no danger … 20
Lallemant’ s account gives a sense of just how politically challenging some
of the material to be found in the Jesuit Relations  must have been to
European audiences of the time, and why so many found it fascinating.
After expanding on how scandalous it was that even murderers should get
off scot-free, the good father did admit that, when considered as a means of
keeping the peace, the W endat system of justice was not inef fective.
Actually , it worked surprisingly well. Rather than punish culprits, the
Wendat insisted the culprit’ s entire lineage or clan pay compensation. This
made it everyone’ s responsibility to keep their kindred under control. ‘It is
not the guilty who suf fer the penalty ,’ Lallemant explains, but rather ‘the
public that must make amends for the of fences of individuals.’ If a Huron
had killed an Algonquin or another Huron, the whole country assembled to
agree the number of gifts due to the grieving relatives, ‘to stay the
vengeance that they might take’.
Wendat ‘captains’, as Lallemant then goes on to describe, ‘ur ge their
subjects to provide what is needed; no one is compelled to it, but those whoare willing bring publicly what they wish to contribute; it seems as if they
vied with one another according to the amount of their wealth, and as the
desire of glory and of appearing solicitous for the public welfare ur ges them
to do on like occasions.’ More remarkable still, he concedes: ‘this form of
justice restrains all these peoples, and seems more ef fectually to repress
disorders than the personal punishment of criminals does in France,’ despite
being ‘a very mild proceeding, which leaves individuals in such a spirit of
liberty that they never submit to any Laws and obey no other impulse than
that of their own will’.21
There are a number of things worth noting here. One is that it makes
clear that some people were indeed considered wealthy . Wendat society was
not ‘economically egalitarian’ in that sense. However , there was a
difference between what we’d consider economic resources – like land,
which was owned by families, worked by women, and whose products were
largely disposed of by women’ s collectives – and the kind of ‘wealth’ being
referred to here, such as wampum  (a word applied to strings and belts of
beads, manufactured from the shells of Long Island’ s quahog clam) or other
treasures, which lar gely existed for political purposes.
Wealthy W endat men hoarded such precious things lar gely to be able to
give them away on dramatic occasions like these. Neither in the case of
land and agricultural products, nor that of wampum  and similar valuables,
was there any way to transform access to material resources into power – at
least, not the kind of power that might allow one to make others work for
you, or compel them to do anything they did not wish to do. At best, the
accumulation and adroit distribution of riches might make a man more
likely to aspire to political ofﬁce (to become a ‘chief ’ or ‘captain’ – the
French sources tend to use these terms in an indiscriminate fashion); but as
the Jesuits all continually emphasized, merely holding political ofﬁce did
not give anyone the right to give anybody orders either . Or, to be
completely accurate, an ofﬁce holder could give all the orders he or she
liked, but no one was under any particular obligation to follow them.
To the Jesuits, of course, all this was outrageous. In fact, their attitude
towards indigenous ideals of liberty is the exact opposite of the attitude
most French people or Canadians tend to hold today: that, in principle,
freedom is an altogether admirable ideal. Father Lallemant, though, was
willing to admit that in practice such a system worked quite well; it created‘much less disorder than there is in France’ – but, as he noted, the Jesuits
were opposed to freedom in principle:
This, without doubt, is a disposition quite contrary to the spirit of
the Faith, which requires us to submit not only our wills, but our
minds, our judgments, and all the sentiments of man to a power
unknown to our senses, to a Law that is not of earth, and that is
entirely opposed to the laws and sentiments of corrupt nature. Add
to this that the laws of the Country , which to them seem most just,
attack the purity of the Christian life in a thousand ways, especially
as regards their marriages … 22
The Jesuit Relations  are full of this sort of thing: scandalized missionaries
frequently reported that American women were considered to have full
control over their own bodies, and that therefore unmarried women had
sexual liberty and married women could divorce at will. This, for the
Jesuits, was an outrage. Such sinful conduct, they believed, was just the
extension of a more general principle of freedom, rooted in natural
dispositions, which they saw as inherently pernicious. The ‘wicked liberty
of the savages’, one insisted, was the single greatest impediment to their
‘submitting to the yoke of the law of God’.23 Even ﬁnding terms to
translate concepts like ‘lord’, ‘commandment’ or ‘obedience’ into
indigenous languages was extremely difﬁcult; explaining the underlying
theological concepts, well-nigh impossible.
IN WHICH WE SHOW HOW EUROPEANS LEARNED FROM
(NATIVE) AMERICANS ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
REASONED DEBA TE, PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND THE
REFUSAL OF ARBITRAR Y POWER
In political terms, then, French and Americans were not ar guing about
equality but about freedom. About the only speciﬁc reference to political
equality that appears in the seventy-one volumes of The Jesuit Relations
occurs almost as an aside, in an account of an event in 1648. It happened in
a settlement of Christianized W endat near the town of Quebec. After a
disturbance caused by a shipload of illegal liquor ﬁnding its way into the
community , the governor persuaded W endat leaders to agree to aprohibition of alcoholic beverages, and published an edict to that ef fect –
crucially , the governor notes, backed up by threat of punishment. Father
Lallemant, again, records the story . For him, this was an epochal event:
‘From the beginning of the world to the coming of the French, the
Savages have never known what it was so solemnly to forbid
anything to their people, under any penalty , however slight. They
are free people, each of whom considers himself of as much
consequence as the others; and they submit to their chiefs only in so
far as it pleases them.’24
Equality here is a direct extension of freedom; indeed, is its expression. It
also has almost nothing in common with the more familiar (Eurasian)
notion of ‘equality before the law’, which is ultimately equality before the
sovereign – that is, once again, equality in common subjugation.
Americans, by contrast, were equal insofar as they were equally free to
obey or disobey orders as they saw ﬁt. The democratic governance of the
Wendat and Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee, which so impressed later
European readers, was an expression of the same principle: if no
compulsion was allowed, then obviously such social coherence as did exist
had to be created through reasoned debate, persuasive ar guments and the
establishment of social consensus.
Here we return to the matter with which we began: the European
Enlightenment as the apotheosis of the principle of open and rational
debate. W e’ve already mentioned Sagard’ s grudging respect for the W endat
facility in logical ar gumentation (a theme that also runs through most Jesuit
accounts). At this point, it is important to bear in mind that the Jesuits were
the intellectuals of the Catholic world. T rained in classical rhetoric and
techniques of disputation, Jesuits had learned the Americans’ languages
primarily so as to be able to ar gue with them, to persuade them of the
superiority of the Christian faith. Y et they regularly found themselves
startled and impressed by the quality of the counterar guments they had to
contend with.
How could such rhetorical facility have come to those with no awareness
of the works of V arro and Quintilian? In considering the matter , the Jesuits
almost always noted the openness with which public af fairs were
conducted. So, Father Le Jeune, Superior of the Jesuits in Canada in the1630s: ‘There are almost none of them incapable of conversing or reasoning
very well, and in good terms, on matters within their knowledge. The
councils, held almost every day in the V illages, and on almost all matters,
improve their capacity for talking.’ Or , in Lallemant’ s words: ‘I can say in
truth that, as regards intelligence, they are in no wise inferior to Europeans
and to those who dwell in France. I would never have believed that, without
instruction, nature could have supplied a most ready and vigorous
eloquence, which I have admired in many Hurons; or more clear -
sightedness in public af fairs, or a more discreet management in things to
which they are accustomed.’25 Some Jesuits went further , remarking – not
without a trace of frustration – that New W orld savages seemed rather
cleverer overall than the people they were used to dealing with at home
(e.g. ‘they nearly all show more intelligence in their business, speeches,
courtesies, intercourse, tricks, and subtleties, than do the shrewdest citizens
and merchants in France’).26
Jesuits, then, clearly recognized and acknowledged an intrinsic relation
between refusal of arbitrary power , open and inclusive political debate and
a taste for reasoned ar gument. It’ s true that Native American political
leaders, who in most cases had no means to compel anyone to do anything
they had not agreed to do, were famous for their rhetorical powers. Even
hardened European generals pursuing genocidal campaigns against
indigenous peoples often reported themselves reduced to tears by their
powers of eloquence. Still, persuasiveness need not take the form of logical
argumentation; it can just as easily involve appeal to sentiment, whipping
up passions, deploying poetic metaphors, appealing to myth or proverbial
wisdom, employing irony and indirection, humour , insult, or appeals to
prophecy or revelation; and the degree to which one privileges any of these
has everything to do with the rhetorical tradition to which the speaker
belongs, and the presumed dispositions of their audience.
It was lar gely the speakers of Iroquoian languages such as the W endat, or
the ﬁve Haudenosaunee nations to their south, who appear to have placed
such weight on reasoned debate – even ﬁnding it a form of pleasurable
entertainment in own right. This fact alone had major historical
repercussions. Because it appears to have been exactly this form of debate –
rational, sceptical, empirical, conversational in tone – which before long
came to be identiﬁed with the European Enlightenment as well. And, just
like the Jesuits, Enlightenment thinkers and democratic revolutionaries sawit as intrinsically connected with the rejection of arbitrary authority ,
particularly that which had long been assumed by the cler gy.
Let’s gather together the strands of our ar gument so far .
By the mid seventeenth century , legal and political thinkers in Europe
were beginning to toy with the idea of an egalitarian State of Nature; at
least in the minimal sense of a default state that might be shared by
societies which they saw as lacking government, writing, religion, private
property or other signiﬁcant means of distinguishing themselves from one
another . Terms like ‘equality’ and ‘inequality’ were just beginning to come
into common usage in intellectual circles – around the time, indeed, that the
ﬁrst French missionaries set out to evangelize the inhabitants of what are
now Nova Scotia and Quebec.27 Europe’ s reading public was growing
increasingly curious about what such primordial societies might have been
like. But they had no particular disposition to imagine men and women
living in a State of Nature as especially ‘noble’, let alone as rational
sceptics and champions of individual liberty .28 This latter perspective was
the product of a dialogic encounter .
As we’ve seen, at ﬁrst neither side – not the colonists of New France, nor
their indigenous interlocutors – had much to say about ‘equality’. Rather ,
the ar gument was about liberty and mutual aid, or what might even be better
called freedom and communism. W e should be clear about what we mean
by the latter term. Since the early nineteenth century , there have been lively
debates about whether there was ever a thing that might legitimately be
referred to as ‘primitive communism’. At the centre of these debates, almost
invariably , were the indigenous societies of the Northeast W oodlands – ever
since Friedrich Engels used the Iroquois as a prime example of primitive
communism in his The Origin of the Family , Private Pr operty and the State
(1884). Here, ‘communism’ always refers to communal ownership,
particularly of productive resources. As we’ve already observed, many
American societies could be considered somewhat ambiguous in this sense:
women owned and worked the ﬁelds individually , even though they stored
and disposed of the products collectively; men owned their own tools and
weapons individually , even if they typically shared out the game and spoils.
However , there’ s another way to use the word ‘communism’: not as a
property regime but in the original sense of ‘from each according to their
abilities, to each according to their needs’. There’ s also a certain minimal,‘baseline’ communism which applies in all societies; a feeling that if
another person’ s needs are great enough (say , they are drowning), and the
cost of meeting them is modest enough (say , they are asking for you to
throw them a rope), then of course any decent person would comply .
Baseline communism of this sort could even be considered the very grounds
of human sociability , since it is only one’ s bitter enemies who would not be
treated this way . What varies is just how far it is felt such baseline
communism should properly extend.
In many societies – and American societies of that time appear to have
been among them – it would have been quite inconceivable to refuse a
request for food. For seventeenth-century Frenchmen in North America,
this was clearly not the case: their range of baseline communism appears to
have been quite restricted, and did not extend to food and shelter –
something which scandalized Americans. But just as we earlier witnessed a
confrontation between two very dif ferent concepts of equality , here we are
ultimately witnessing a clash between very dif ferent concepts of
individualism. Europeans were constantly squabbling for advantage;
societies of the Northeast W oodlands, by contrast, guaranteed one another
the means to an autonomous life – or at least ensured no man or woman was
subordinated to any other . Insofar as we can speak of communism, it
existed not in opposition to but in support of individual freedom.
The same could be said of indigenous political systems that Europeans
encountered across much of the Great Lakes region. Everything operated to
ensure that no one’ s will would be subjugated to that of anyone else. It was
only over time, as Americans learned more about Europe, and Europeans
began to consider what it would mean to translate American ideals of
individual liberty into their own societies, that the term ‘equality’ began to
gain ground as a feature of the discourse between them.
IN WHICH WE INTRODUCE THE WENDA T PHILOSOPHER-
STATESMAN KANDIARONK, AND EXPLAIN HOW HIS VIEWS
ON HUMAN NA TURE AND SOCIETY T OOK ON NEW LIFE IN
THE SALONS OF ENLIGHTENMENT EUROPE (INCLUDING AN
ASIDE ON THE CONCEPT OF ‘SCHISMOGENESIS’)
In order to understand how the indigenous critique – that consistent moral
and intellectual assault on European society , widely voiced by NativeAmerican observers from the seventeenth century onwards – evolved, and
its full impact on European thinking, we ﬁrst need to understand something
about the role of two men: an impoverished French aristocrat named Louis-
Armand de Lom d’Arce, Baron de la Hontan, and an unusually brilliant
Wendat statesman named Kandiaronk.
In 1683, Lahontan (as he came to be known), then seventeen years old,
joined the French army and was posted to Canada. Over the course of the
next decade he took part in a number of campaigns and exploratory
expeditions, eventually attaining the rank of deputy to the Governor -
General, the Comte de Frontenac. In the process he became ﬂuent in both
Algonkian and W endat, and – by his own account at least – good friends
with a number of indigenous political ﬁgures. Lahontan later claimed that,
because he was something of a sceptic in religious matters and a political
enemy of the Jesuits, these ﬁgures were willing to share with him their
actual opinions about Christian teachings. One of them was Kandiaronk.
A key strategist of the W endat Confederacy , a coalition of four
Iroquoian-speaking peoples, Kandiaronk (his name literally meant ‘the
muskrat’ and the French often referred to him simply as ‘Le Rat’) was at
that time engaged in a complex geopolitical game, trying to play the
English, French and Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee of f against each
other , with the initial aim of averting a disastrous Haudenosaunee assault on
the W endat, but with the long-term goal of creating a comprehensive
indigenous alliance to hold of f the settler advance.29 Everyone who met
him, friend or foe, admitted he was a truly remarkable individual: a
courageous warrior , brilliant orator and unusually skilful politician. He was
also, to the very end of his life, a staunch opponent of Christianity .30
Lahontan’ s own career came to a bad end. Despite having successfully
defended Nova Scotia against an English ﬂeet, he ran foul of its governor
and was forced to ﬂee French territory . Convicted in absentia of
insubordination, he spent most of the next decade in exile, wandering about
Europe trying, unsuccessfully , to negotiate a return to his native France. By
1702, Lahontan was living in Amsterdam and very much down on his luck,
described by those who met him as penniless vagrant and freelance spy . All
that was to change when he published a series of books about his
adventures in Canada.
Two were memoirs of his American adventures. The third, entitled
Curious Dialogues with a Savage of Good Sense Who Has T ravelled(1703), comprised a series of four conversations between Lahontan and
Kandiaronk, in which the W endat sage – voicing opinions based on his own
ethnographic observations of Montreal, New Y ork and Paris – casts an
extremely critical eye on European mores and ideas about religion, politics,
health and sexual life. These books won a wide audience, and before long
Lahontan had become something of a minor celebrity . He settled at the
court of Hanover , which was also the home base for Leibniz, who
befriended and supported him before Lahontan fell ill and died, around
1715.
Most criticism of Lahontan’ s work simply assumes as a matter of course
that the dialogues are made up, and that the ar guments attributed to
‘Adario’ (the name given there to Kandiaronk) are the opinions of Lahontan
himself.31 In a way , this conclusion is unsurprising. Adario claims not only
to have visited France, but expresses opinions on everything from monastic
politics to legal af fairs. In the debate on religion, he often sounds like an
advocate of the deist position that spiritual truth should be sought in reason,
not revelation, embracing just the sort of rational scepticism that was
becoming popular in Europe’ s more daring intellectual circles at the time. It
is also true that the style of Lahontan’ s dialogues seems partly inspired by
the ancient Greek writings of the satirist Lucian; and also that, given the
prevalence of Church censorship in France at the time, the easiest way for a
freethinker to get away with publishing an open attack on Christianity
probably would have been to compose a dialogue pretending to defend the
faith from the attacks of an imaginary foreign sceptic – and then make sure
one loses all the ar guments.
In recent decades, however , indigenous scholars returned to the material
in light of what we know about Kandiaronk himself – and came to very
different conclusions.32 The real-life Adario was famous not only for his
eloquence, but was known for engaging in debates with Europeans of just
the sort recorded in Lahontan’ s book. As Barbara Alice Mann remarks,
despite the almost unanimous chorus of W estern scholars insisting the
dialogues are imaginary , ‘there is excellent reason for accepting them as
genuine.’ First, there are the ﬁrst-hand accounts of Kandiaronk’ s oratorical
skills and dazzling wit. Father Pierre de Charlevoix described Kandiaronk
as so ‘naturally eloquent’ that ‘no one perhaps ever exceeded him in mental
capacity .’ An exceptional council speaker , ‘he was not less brilliant in
conversation in private, and [councilmen and negotiators] often tookpleasure in provoking him to hear his repartees, always animated, full of
wit, and generally unanswerable. He was the only man in Canada who was
a match for the [governor] Count de Frontenac, who often invited him to his
table to give his ofﬁcers this pleasure.’33
During the 1690s, in other words, the Montreal-based governor and his
ofﬁcers (presumably including his sometime deputy , Lahontan) hosted a
proto-Enlightenment salon, where they invited Kandiaronk to debate
exactly the sort of matters that appeared in the Dialogues , and in which it
was Kandiaronk who took the position of rational sceptic.
What’ s more, there is every reason to believe that Kandiaronk actually
had been to France; that’ s to say , we know the W endat Confederation did
send an ambassador to visit the court of Louis XIV in 1691, and
Kandiaronk’ s ofﬁce at the time was Speaker of the Council, which would
have made him the logical person to send. While the intimate knowledge of
European af fairs and understanding of European psychology attributed to
Adario might seem implausible, Kandiaronk was a man who had been
engaged in political negotiations with Europeans for years, and regularly
ran circles around them by anticipating their logic, interests, blind spots and
reactions. Finally , many of the critiques of Christianity , and European ways
more generally , attributed to Adario correspond almost exactly to criticisms
that are documented from other speakers of Iroquoian languages around the
same time.34
Lahontan himself claimed to have based the Dialogues  on notes jotted
down during or after a variety of conversations he’d had with Kandiaronk at
Michilimackinac, on the strait between Lakes Huron and Michigan; notes
that he later reor ganized with the governor ’s help and which were
supplemented, no doubt, by reminiscences both had of similar debates held
over Frontenac’ s own dinner table. In the process the text was no doubt
augmented and embellished, and probably tweaked again when Lahontan
produced his ﬁnal edition in Amsterdam. There is, however , every reason to
believe the basic ar guments were Kandiaronk’ s own.
Lahontan anticipates some of these ar guments in his Memoirs , when he
notes that Americans who had actually been to Europe – here, he was very
likely thinking primarily of Kandiaronk himself, as well as a number of
former captives who had been put to work as galley slaves – came back
contemptuous of European claims to cultural superiority . Those Native
Americans who had been in France, he wrote,… were continually teasing us with the faults and disorders they
observed in our towns, as being occasioned by money . There’ s no
point in trying to remonstrate with them about how useful the
distinction of property is for the support of society: they make a joke
of anything you say on that account. In short, they neither quarrel
nor ﬁght, nor slander one another; they scof f at arts and sciences,
and laugh at the dif ference of ranks which is observed with us. They
brand us for slaves, and call us miserable souls, whose life is not
worth having, alleging that we degrade ourselves in subjecting
ourselves to one man [the king] who possesses all the power , and is
bound by no law but his own will.
In other words, we ﬁnd here all the familiar criticisms of European society
that the earliest missionaries had to contend with – the squabbling, the lack
of mutual aid, the blind submission to authority – but with a new element
added in: the or ganization of private property . Lahontan continues: ‘They
think it unaccountable that one man should have more than another , and that
the rich should have more respect than the poor . In short, they say , the name
of savages, which we bestow upon them, would ﬁt ourselves better , since
there is nothing in our actions that bears an appearance of wisdom.’
Native Americans who had the opportunity to observe French society
from up close had come to realize one key dif ference from their own, one
which may not otherwise have been apparent. Whereas in their own
societies there was no obvious way to convert wealth into power over
others (with the consequence that dif ferences of wealth had little ef fect on
individual freedom), in France the situation could not have been more
different. Power over possessions could be directly translated into power
over other human beings.
But here let us give the ﬂoor to Kandiaronk himself. The ﬁrst of the
Dialogues  is about religious matters, in which Lahontan allows his foil
calmly to pick apart the logical contradictions and incoherence of the
Christian doctrines of original sin and redemption, paying particular
attention to the concept of hell. As well as casting doubt on the historicity
of scripture, Kandiaronk continually emphasizes the fact that Christians are
divided into endless sects, each convinced they are entirely right and that all
the others are hell-bound. T o give a sense of its ﬂavour:Kandiar onk: Come on, my brother . Don’ t get up in arms … It’ s
only natural for Christians to have faith in the holy scriptures, since,
from their infancy , they’ve heard so much of them. Still, it is
nothing if not reasonable for those born without such prejudice, such
as the W endats, to examine matters more closely .
However , having thought long and hard over the course of a
decade about what the Jesuits have told us of the life and death of
the son of the Great Spirit, any W endat could give you twenty
reasons against the notion. For myself, I’ve always held that, if it
were possible that God had lowered his standards sufﬁciently to
come down to earth, he would have done it in full view of everyone,
descending in triumph, with pomp and majesty , and most publicly
… He would have gone from nation to nation performing mighty
miracles, thus giving everyone the same laws. Then we would all
have had exactly the same religion, uniformly spread and equally
known throughout the four corners of the world, proving to our
descendants, from then till ten thousand years into the future, the
truth of this religion. Instead, there are ﬁve or six hundred religions,
each distinct from the other , of which according to you, the religion
of the French, alone, is any good, sainted, or true.35
The last passage reﬂects perhaps Kandiaronk’ s most telling point: the
extraordinary self-importance of the Jesuit conviction that an all-knowing
and all-powerful being would freely choose to entrap himself in ﬂesh and
under go terrible suf fering, all for the sake of a single species, designed to be
imperfect, only some of which were going to be rescued from damnation
anyway .36
There follows a chapter on the subject of law , where Kandiaronk takes
the position that European-style punitive law , like the religious doctrine of
eternal damnation, is not necessitated by any inherent corruption of human
nature, but rather by a form of social or ganization that encourages selﬁsh
and acquisitive behaviour . Lahontan objects: true, reason is the same for all
humans, but the very existence of judges and punishment shows that not
everyone is capable of following its dictates:
Lahontan : This is why the wicked need to be punished, and the
good need to be rewarded. Otherwise, murder , robbery anddefamation would spread everywhere, and, in a word, we would
become the most miserable people upon the face of the earth.
Kandiar onk: For my own part, I ﬁnd it hard to see how you could
be much more miserable than you already are. What kind of human,
what species of creature, must Europeans be, that they have to be
forced to do good, and only refrain from evil because of fear of
punishment? …
You have observed that we lack judges. What is the reason for
that? W ell, we never bring lawsuits against one another . And why do
we never bring lawsuits? W ell, because we made a decision neither
to accept or make use of money . And why do we refuse to allow
money into our communities? The reason is this: we are determined
not to have laws – because, since the world was a world, our
ancestors have been able to live contentedly without them.
Given that the W endat most certainly did have a legal code, this might seem
disingenuous on Kandiaronk’ s part. By laws, however , he is clearly
referring to laws of a coercive or punitive nature. He goes on to dissect the
failings of the French legal system, dwelling particularly on judicial
persecution, false testimony , torture, witchcraft accusations and dif ferential
justice for rich and poor . In conclusion, he swings back to his original
observation: the whole apparatus of trying to force people to behave well
would be unnecessary if France did not also maintain a contrary apparatus
that encourages people to behave badly . That apparatus consisted of money ,
property rights and the resultant pursuit of material self-interest:
Kandiar onk:  I have spent six years reﬂecting on the state of
European society and I still can’ t think of a single way they act
that’s not inhuman, and I genuinely think this can only be the case,
as long as you stick to your distinctions of ‘mine’ and ‘thine’. I
afﬁrm that what you call money is the devil of devils; the tyrant of
the French, the source of all evils; the bane of souls and
slaughterhouse of the living. T o imagine one can live in the country
of money and preserve one’ s soul is like imagining one could
preserve one’ s life at the bottom of a lake. Money is the father of
luxury , lasciviousness, intrigues, trickery , lies, betrayal, insincerity ,– of all the world’ s worst behaviour . Fathers sell their children,
husbands their wives, wives betray their husbands, brothers kill each
other , friends are false, and all because of money . In the light of all
this, tell me that we W endat are not right in refusing to touch, or so
much as to look at silver?
For Europeans in 1703, this was heady stuf f.
Much of the subsequent exchange consists of the Frenchman trying to
convince Kandiaronk of the advantages of adopting European civilization,
and Kandiaronk countering that the French would do much better to adopt
the W endat way of life. Do you seriously imagine, he says, that I would be
happy to live like one of the inhabitants of Paris, to take two hours every
morning just to put on my shirt and make-up, to bow and scrape before
every obnoxious galoot I meet on the street who happened to have been
born with an inheritance? Do you really imagine I could carry a purse full
of coins and not immediately hand them over to people who are hungry;
that I would carry a sword but not immediately draw it on the ﬁrst band of
thugs I see rounding up the destitute to press them into naval service? If, on
the other hand, Lahontan were to adopt an American way of life,
Kandiaronk tells him, it might take a while to adjust – but in the end he’d be
far happier . (Kandiaronk had a point, as we’ve seen in the last chapter;
settlers adopted into indigenous societies almost never wanted to go back.)
Kandiaronk is even willing to propose that Europe would be better of f if
its whole social system was dismantled:
Lahontan:  Try for once in your life to actually listen. Can’ t you see,
my dear friend, that the nations of Europe could not survive without
gold and silver – or some similar precious symbol. W ithout it,
nobles, priests, merchants and any number of others who lack the
strength to work the soil would simply die of hunger . Our kings
would not be kings; what soldiers would we have? Who would work
for kings, or anybody else? … It would plunge Europe into chaos
and create the most dismal confusion imaginable.
Kandiar onk:  You honestly think you’re going to sway me by
appealing to the needs of nobles, merchants and priests? If you
abandoned conceptions of mine and thine, yes, such distinctionsbetween men would dissolve; a levelling equality would then take
its place among you as it now does among the W endat. And yes, for
the ﬁrst thirty years after the banishing of self-interest, no doubt you
would indeed see a certain desolation as those who are only
qualiﬁed to eat, drink, sleep and take pleasure would languish and
die. But their progeny would be ﬁt for our way of living. Over and
over I have set forth the qualities that we W endat believe ought to
deﬁne humanity – wisdom, reason, equity , etc. – and demonstrated
that the existence of separate material interests knocks all these on
the head. A man motivated by interest cannot be a man of reason.
Here, ﬁnally , ‘equality’ is invoked as a self-conscious ideal – but only as the
result of a prolonged confrontation between American and European
institutions and values, and as a calculated provocation, turning European
civilizing discourse backwards on itself.
One reason why modern commentators have found it so easy to dismiss
Kandiaronk as the ultimate ‘noble savage’ (and, therefore, as a mere
projection of European fantasies) is because many of his assertions are so
obviously exaggerated. It’ s not really true that the W endat, or other
American societies, had no laws, never quarrelled and knew no inequalities
of wealth. At the same time, as we’ve seen, Kandiaronk’ s basic line of
argument is perfectly consistent with what French missionaries and settlers
in North America had been hearing from other indigenous Americans. T o
argue that because the Dialogues  romanticize, they can’ t really reﬂect what
he said, is to assume that people are incapable of romanticizing themselves
– despite the fact that this is what any skilful debater is likely to do under
such circumstances, and all sources concur that Kandiaronk was perhaps the
most skilful they’d ever met.
Back in the 1930s, the anthropologist Gregory Bateson coined the term
‘schismogenesis’ to describe people’ s tendency to deﬁne themselves against
one another .37 Imagine two people getting into an ar gument about some
minor political disagreement but, after an hour , ending up taking positions
so intransigent that they ﬁnd themselves on completely opposite sides of
some ideological divide – even taking extreme positions they would never
embrace under ordinary circumstances, just to show how much they
completely reject the other ’s points. They start out as moderate socialdemocrats of slightly dif ferent ﬂavours; before a few heated hours are over ,
one has somehow become a Leninist, the other an advocate of the ideas of
Milton Friedman. W e know this kind of thing can happen in ar guments.
Bateson suggested such processes can become institutionalized on a cultural
level as well. How , he asked, do boys and girls in Papua New Guinea come
to behave so dif ferently , despite the fact that no one ever explicitly instructs
them about how boys and girls are supposed to behave? It’ s not just by
imitating their elders; it’ s also because boys and girls each learn to ﬁnd the
behaviour of the opposite sex distasteful and try to be as little like them as
possible. What start as minor learned dif ferences become exaggerated until
women come to think of themselves as, and then increasingly actually
become, everything that men are not. And, of course, men do the same
thing towards women.
Bateson was interested in psychological processes within societies, but
there’ s every reason to believe something similar happens between  societies
as well. People come to deﬁne themselves against their neighbours.
Urbanites thus become more urbane, as barbarians become more barbarous.
If ‘national character ’ can really be said to exist, it can only be as a result of
such schismogenetic processes: English people trying to become as little as
possible like French, French people as little like Germans, and so on. If
nothing else, they will all deﬁnitely exaggerate their dif ferences in ar guing
with one another .
In a historical confrontation of civilizations like that taking place along
the east coast of North America in the seventeenth century , we can expect to
see two contradictory processes. On the one hand, it is only to be expected
that people on both sides of the divide will learn from one another and
adopt each other ’s ideas, habits and technologies (Americans began using
European muskets; European settlers began to adopt more indulgent
American approaches to disciplining children). At the same time, they will
also almost invariably do the opposite, picking out certain points of contrast
and exaggerating or idealizing them – eventually even trying to act, in some
respects, as little like their new neighbours as possible.
Kandiaronk’ s focus on money is typical of such situations. T o this day ,
indigenous societies incorporated into the global economy , from Bolivia to
Taiwan, almost invariably frame their own traditions, as Marshall Sahlins
puts it, by opposition to the white man’ s ‘living in the way of money’.38All these would be rather trivial concerns had Lahontan’ s books not been so
successful; but they were to have an enormous impact on European
sensibilities. Kandiaronk’ s opinions were translated into German, English,
Dutch and Italian, and continued in print, in multiple editions, for over a
century . Any self-respecting intellectual of the eighteenth century would
have been almost certain to have read them. They also inspired a ﬂood of
imitations. By 1721, Parisian theatregoers were ﬂocking to Delisle de la
Drevetière’ s comedy L’Arlequin sauvage : the story of a W endat brought to
France by a young sea captain, featuring a long series of indignant
monologues in which the hero ‘attributes the ills of [French] society to
private property , to money , and in particular to the monstrous inequality
which makes the poor the slaves of the rich’.39 The play was revived
almost yearly for the next two decades.40
Even more strikingly , just about every major French Enlightenment
ﬁgure tried their hand at a Lahontan-style critique of their own society , from
the perspective of some imagined outsider . Montesquieu chose a Persian;
the Marquis d’Ar gens a Chinese; Diderot a T ahitian; Chateaubriand a
Natchez; V oltaire’ s L’Ingénu  was half W endat and half French.41 All took
up and developed themes and ar guments borrowed directly from
Kandiaronk, supplemented by lines from other ‘savage critics’ in travellers’
accounts.42 Indeed, a strong case can be made for the real origins of the
‘Western gaze’ – that rational, supposedly objective way of looking at
strange and exotic cultures which came to characterize later European
anthropology – lying not in travellers’ accounts, but rather in European
accounts of precisely these imaginary sceptical natives: gazing inwards,
brows furrowed, at the exotic curiosities of Europe itself.
Perhaps the single most popular work of this genre, published in 1747,
was Letters of a Peruvian W oman  by the prominent saloniste  Madame de
Grafﬁgny , which viewed French society through the eyes of an imaginary
kidnapped Inca princess. The book is considered a feminist landmark, in
that it may well be the ﬁrst European novel about a woman which does not
end with the protagonist either marrying or dying. Grafﬁgny’ s Inca heroine,
Zilia, is as critical of the vanities and absurdities of European society as she
is of patriarchy . By the nineteenth century , the novel was remembered in
some quarters as the ﬁrst work to introduce the notion of state socialism to
the general public, Zilia wondering why the French king, despite levying allsorts of heavy taxes, cannot simply redistribute the wealth in the same
manner as the Sapa Inca.43
In 1751, preparing a second edition of her book, Madame de Grafﬁgny
sent letters to a variety of friends asking for suggested changes. One of
these correspondents was a twenty-three-year -old seminary student and
budding economist, A. R. J. T urgot, and we happen to have a copy of his
reply – which was long and highly (if constructively) critical. T urgot’s text
could hardly be more important, since it marks a key moment in his own
intellectual development: the point where he began to turn his most lasting
contribution to human thought – the idea of material economic progress –
into a general theory of history .
IN WHICH WE EXPLAIN THE DEMIURGIC POWERS OF A. R. J.
TURGOT , AND HOW HE TURNED THE INDIGENOUS
CRITIQUE OF EUROPEAN CIVILIZA TION ON ITS HEAD,
LAYING THE BASIS FOR MOST MODERN VIEWS OF SOCIAL
EVOLUTION (OR: HOW AN ARGUMENT ABOUT ‘FREEDOM’
BECAME ONE ABOUT ‘EQUALITY’)
The Inca Empire could hardly be described as ‘egalitarian’ – indeed, it was
an empire – but Madame de Grafﬁgny represented it as a benevolent
despotism; one in which all are ultimately equal before the king. Zilia’ s
critique of France, like that of all imaginary outsiders writing in the
tradition of Kandiaronk, focuses on the lack of individual freedom in
French society and its violent inequalities.44 But T urgot found such
thinking disturbing, even dangerous.
Yes, T urgot acknowledged, ‘we all love the idea of freedom and equality’
– in principle. But we must consider a lar ger context. In reality , he ventured,
the freedom and equality of savages is not a sign of their superiority; it’ s a
sign of inferiority , since it is only possible in a society where each
household is lar gely self-sufﬁcient and, therefore, where everyone is
equally poor . As societies evolve, T urgot reasoned, technology advances.
Natural dif ferences in talents and capacities between individuals (which
have always existed) become more signiﬁcant, and eventually they form the
basis for an ever more complex division of labour . We progress from simple
societies like those of the W endat to our own complex ‘commercial
civilization’, in which the poverty and dispossession of some – howeverlamentable it may be – is nonetheless the necessary condition for the
prosperity of society as a whole.
There is no avoiding such inequality , concluded T urgot in his reply to
Madame de Grafﬁgny . The only alternative, according to him, would be
massive, Inca-style state intervention to create a uniformity of social
conditions: an enforced equality which could only have the ef fect of
crushing all initiative and, therefore, result in economic and social
catastrophe. In light of all this, T urgot suggested Madame de Grafﬁgny
rewrite her novel in such a way as to have Zilia realize these terrible
implications at the end of the book.
Unsurprisingly , Grafﬁgny ignored his advice.
A few years later , Turgot would elaborate these same ideas in a series of
lectures on world history . He had already been ar guing – for some years –
for the primacy of technological progress as a driver for overall social
improvement. In these lectures, he developed this ar gument into an explicit
theory of stages of economic development: social evolution, he reasoned,
always begins with hunters, then moves on to a stage of pastoralism, then
farming, and only then ﬁnally passes to the contemporary stage of urban
commercial civilization.45 Those who still remain hunters, shepherds or
simple farmers are best understood as vestiges of our own previous stages
of social development.
In this way , theories of social evolution – now so familiar that we rarely
dwell on their origins – ﬁrst came to be articulated in Europe: as a direct
response to the power of indigenous critique. W ithin a few years, T urgot’s
breakdown of all societies into four stages was appearing in the lectures of
his friend and intellectual ally Adam Smith in Glasgow , and was worked
into a general theory of human history by Smith’ s colleagues: men like
Lord Kames, Adam Fer guson and John Millar . The new paradigm soon
began to have a profound ef fect on how indigenous people were imagined
by European thinkers, and by the European public more generally .
Observers who had previously considered the modes of subsistence and
division of labour in North American societies to be trivial matters, or of at
best secondary importance, now began assuming that they were the only
thing that really mattered. Everyone was to be sorted along the same grand
evolutionary ladder , depending on their primary mode of acquiring food.
‘Egalitarian’ societies were banished to the bottom of this ladder , where at
best they could provide some insight on how our distant ancestors mighthave lived; but certainly could no longer be imagined as equal parties to a
dialogue about how the inhabitants of wealthy and powerful societies
should conduct themselves in the present.
Let’s pause for a moment to take stock. In the years between 1703 and
1751, as we’ve seen, the indigenous American critique of European society
had an enormous impact on European thought. What began as widespread
expressions of outrage and distaste by Americans (when ﬁrst exposed to
European mores) eventually evolved, through a thousand conversations,
conducted in dozens of languages from Portuguese to Russian, into an
argument about the nature of authority , decency , social responsibility and,
above all, freedom. As it became clear to French observers that most
indigenous Americans saw individual autonomy and freedom of action as
consummate values – or ganizing their own lives in such a way as to
minimize any possibility of one human being becoming subordinated to the
will of another , and hence viewing French society as essentially one of
fractious slaves – they reacted in a variety of dif ferent ways.
Some, like the Jesuits, condemned the principle of freedom outright.
Others – settlers, intellectuals and members of the reading public back
home – came to see it as a provocative and appealing social proposition.
(Their conclusions on this matter , incidentally , bore no particular relation to
their feelings about indigenous populations themselves, whom they were
often happy to see exterminated – though, in fairness, there were public
ﬁgures on both sides of the intellectual divide who strongly opposed
aggression against foreign peoples.) In fact, the indigenous critique of
European institutions was seen as so powerful that anyone objecting to
existing intellectual and social arrangements would tend to deploy it as a
weapon of choice: a game, as we’ve seen, played by pretty much every one
of the great Enlightenment philosophers.
In the process – and we’ve seen how this was already happening with
Lahontan and Kandiaronk – an ar gument about freedom also became,
increasingly , an ar gument about equality . Above all, though, all these
appeals to the wisdom of ‘savages’ were still ways of challenging the
arrogance of received authority: that medieval certainty which maintained
that the judgments of the Church and the establishment it upheld, having
embraced the correct version of Christianity , were necessarily superior to
those of anyone else on earth.Turgot’s case reveals just how much those particular notions of
civilization, evolution and progress – which we’ve come to think of as the
very core of Enlightenment thought – are, in fact, relative latecomers to that
critical tradition. Most importantly , it shows how the development of these
notions came in direct response to the power of the indigenous critique.
Indeed, it was to take an enormous ef fort to salvage that very sense of
European superiority which Enlightenment thinkers had aimed to upend,
unsettle and de-centre. Certainly , over the next century and more, such ideas
became a remarkably successful strategy for doing so. But they also created
a welter of contradictions: for instance, the peculiar fact that European
colonial empires, unlike almost any other in history , were forced to espouse
their own ephemerality , claiming to be mere temporary vehicles to speed up
their subjects’ march to civilization – at least those subjects who, unlike the
Wendat, they hadn’ t largely wiped of f the map.
At this point we ﬁnd ourselves back full circle with Rousseau.
HOW JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, HA VING WON ONE
PRESTIGIOUS ESSA Y COMPETITION, THEN LOST ANOTHER
(COMING IN OVER THE PERMITTED WORD LENGTH), BUT
FINALL Y WENT ON T O CONQUER THE WHOLE OF HUMAN
HIST ORY
The exchange between Madame de Grafﬁgny and T urgot gives us a sense
of intellectual debate in France in the early 1750s; at least, in the saloniste
circles with which Rousseau was familiar . Were freedom and equality
universal values, or were they – at least in their pure form – inconsistent
with a regime based on private property? Did the progress of arts and
sciences lead to improved understanding of the world, and therefore to
moral progress as well? Or was the indigenous critique correct, and the
wealth and power of France simply a perverse side ef fect of unnatural, even
pathological, social arrangements? These were the questions on every
debater ’s lips at the time.
If we know anything about those debates today , it’s largely because of
their inﬂuence on Rousseau’ s essay . The Discourse on the Origins of Social
Inequality  has been taught, debated and picked apart in a thousand
classrooms – which is odd, because in many ways it is very much an
eccentric outlier , even by the standards of its time.In the early part of his life, Rousseau was known mainly as an aspiring
composer . His rise to prominence as a social thinker began in 1750, when
he took part in a contest sponsored by the same learned society , the
Académie de Dijon, on the question, ‘Has the restoration of the sciences
and arts contributed to moral improvement?’46 Rousseau won ﬁrst prize,
and national fame, with an essay in which he ar gued with great passion that
they had not. Our elementary moral intuitions, he asserted, are
fundamentally decent and sound; civilization merely corrupts by
encouraging us to value form over content. Almost all the examples in this
Discourse on the Arts and Sciences  are taken from classical Greek and
Roman sources – but in his footnotes, Rousseau hints at other sources of
inspiration:
I don’ t dare speak of those happy nations who do not know even the
names of the vices which we have such trouble controlling, of those
American savages whose simple and natural ways of keeping public
order Montaigne does not hesitate to prefer , not merely to the laws
of Plato, but even to anything more perfect which philosophy will
ever be able to dream up for governing a people. He cites a number
of striking examples of these for those who understand how to
admire them. What’ s more, he says, they don’ t wear breeches!47
Rousseau’ s victory sparked something of a scandal. It was considered
controversial, to say the least, for an academy dedicated to the advancement
of the arts and sciences to award top honours to an ar gument stating that the
arts and sciences were entirely counterproductive. As for Rousseau, he
spent much of the next several years writing well-publicized responses to
criticisms of the piece (as well as using his new fame to produce a comic
opera, The V illage Soothsayer , which became popular at the French court).
When in 1754 the Académie de Dijon announced a new contest on the
origins of social inequality , they clearly felt they had to put the upstart in his
place.
Rousseau took the bait. He submitted an even more elaborate treatise,
clearly designed to shock and confound. Not only did it fail to win the prize
(which was bestowed on a very conventional essay by a representative of
the religious establishment named the Abbé T albert, who attributed our
current unequal condition lar gely to original sin), but the judges announcedthat, since Rousseau’ s submission went far over the word limit, they had not
even read it all the way through.
Rousseau’ s essay is undoubtedly odd. It’ s also not exactly what it’ s often
claimed to be. Rousseau does not, in fact, ar gue that human society begins
in a state of idyllic innocence. He ar gues, rather confusingly , that the ﬁrst
humans were essentially good, but nonetheless systematically avoided one
another for fear of violence. As a result, human beings in a State of Nature
were solitary creatures, which allows him to make a case that ‘society’ itself
– that is, any form of ongoing association between individuals – was
necessarily a restraint on human freedom. Even language marked a
compromise. But the real innovation Rousseau introduces comes at the key
moment of humanity’ s ‘fall from grace’, a moment triggered, he ar gues, by
the emer gence of property relations.
Rousseau’ s model of human society – which, he repeatedly emphasizes,
is not meant to be taken literally , but is simply a thought experiment –
involves three stages: a purely imaginary State of Nature, when individuals
lived in isolation from one another; a stage of Stone Age savagery , which
followed the invention of language (in which he includes most of the
modern inhabitants of North America and other actually observable
‘savages’); then ﬁnally , civilization, which followed the invention of
agriculture and metallur gy. Each marks a moral decline. But, as Rousseau is
careful to emphasize, the entire parable is a way to understand what made it
possible for human beings to accept the notion of private property in the
ﬁrst place:
The ﬁrst man who, having enclosed a piece of land, thought of
saying, ‘This is mine’, and found people simple enough to believe
him, was the real founder of civil society . How many crimes, wars
and murders, how much misery and horror the human race would
have been spared if someone had pulled up the stakes and ﬁlled in
the ditch and cried out to his fellow men: ‘Beware of listening to
this impostor . You are lost if you for get that the fruits of the earth
belong to everyone, and that the earth itself belongs to no one!’ But
it is highly probable that by this time things had reached a point
beyond which they could not go on as they were; for the idea of
property , depending on many prior ideas which could only havearisen in successive stages, was not formed all at once in the human
mind.48
Here, Rousseau asks exactly the same question that puzzled so many
indigenous Americans. How is it that Europeans are able to turn wealth into
power; turn a mere unequal distribution of material goods – which exists, at
least to some degree, in any society – into the ability to tell others what to
do, to employ them as servants, workmen or grenadiers, or simply to feel
that it was no concern of theirs if they were left dying in a feverish bundle
on the street?
While Rousseau does not cite Lahontan or the Jesuit Relations  directly ,
he was clearly familiar with them,49 as any intellectual of the time would
have been, and his work is informed by the same critical questions: why are
Europeans so competitive? Why do they not share food? Why do they
submit themselves to other people’ s orders? Rousseau’ s long excursus on
pitié – the natural sympathy that, he ar gues, savages have for one another
and the quality that holds of f the worst depredations of civilization in its
second phase – only makes sense in light of the constant indigenous
exclamations of dismay to be found in those books: that Europeans just
don’t seem to care about each other; that they are ‘neither generous nor
kind’.50
The reason for the essay’ s astonishing success, then, is that for all its
sensationalist style, it’ s really a kind of clever compromise between two or
perhaps even three contradictory positions on the most ur gent social and
moral concerns of eighteenth-century Europe. It manages to incorporate
elements of the indigenous critique, echoes of the biblical narrative of the
Fall, and something that at least looks a great deal like the evolutionary
stages of material development that were only just being propounded,
around that time, by T urgot and Scottish Enlightenment thinkers. Rousseau
agrees, in essence, with Kandiaronk’ s view that civilized Europeans were,
by and lar ge, atrocious creatures, for all the reasons that the W endat had
outlined; and he agrees that property is the root of the problem. The one –
major – dif ference between them is that Rousseau, unlike Kandiaronk,
cannot really envisage society being based on anything else.
In translating the indigenous critique into terms that French philosophers
could understand, this sense of possibility is precisely what was lost. T o
Americans like Kandiaronk, there was no contradiction between individualliberty and communism – that’ s to say , communism in the sense we’ve been
using it here, as a certain presumption of sharing, that people who aren’ t
actual enemies can be expected to respond to one another ’s needs. In the
American view , the freedom of the individual was assumed to be premised
on a certain level of ‘baseline communism’, since, after all, people who are
starving or lack adequate clothes or shelter in a snowstorm are not really
free to do much of anything, other than whatever it takes to stay alive.
The European conception of individual freedom was, by contrast, tied
ineluctably to notions of private property . Legally , this association traces
back above all to the power of the male household head in ancient Rome,
who could do whatever he liked with his chattels and possessions, including
his children and slaves.51 In this view , freedom was always deﬁned – at
least potentially – as something exercised to the cost of others. What’ s
more, there was a strong emphasis in ancient Roman (and modern
European) law on the self-sufﬁciency of households; hence, true freedom
meant autonomy in the radical sense, not just autonomy of the will, but
being in no way dependent on other human beings (except those under
one’s direct control). Rousseau, who always insisted he wished to live
without being dependent on others’ help (even as he had all his needs
attended to by mistresses and servants), played out this very same logic in
the conduct of his own life.52
When our ancestors, Rousseau wrote, made the fatal decision to divide
the earth into individually owned plots, creating legal structures to protect
their property , then governments to enforce those laws, they imagined they
were creating the means to preserve their liberty . In fact, they ‘ran headlong
to their chains’. This is a powerful image, but it is unclear what Rousseau
felt this lost liberty would actually have looked like; especially if, as he
insisted, any ongoing human relationship, even one of mutual aid, is itself a
restraint on liberty . It’s hardly surprising that he ends up inventing a purely
imaginary age in which each individual wandered alone among the trees;
more surprising, perhaps, that his imaginary world has come so often to
deﬁne the arc of our own horizons. How did this happen?
IN WHICH WE CONSIDER RELA TIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE
INDIGENOUS CRITIQUE, THE MYTH OF PROGRESS AND THE
BIRTH OF THE LEFTAs we’ve mentioned before, in the wake of the French Revolution
conservative critics blamed Rousseau for almost everything. Many held him
personally responsible for the guillotine. The dream of restoring the ancient
state of liberty and equality , they ar gued, led to exactly the ef fects T urgot
had predicted: an Inca-style totalitarianism that could only be enforced
through revolutionary terror .
It is true that political radicals at the time of the American and French
Revolutions embraced Rousseau’ s ideas. Here, for example, is an extract
purportedly from a manifesto written in 1776 which almost perfectly
reproduces Rousseau’ s fusion of evolutionism and critique of private
property as leading directly to the origins of the state:
As families multiplied, the means of subsistence began to fail; the
nomad  (or roaming) life ceased, and PROPER TY started into
existence; men chose habitations; agriculture made them intermix.
Language became universal; living together , one man began to
measure his strength with another , and the weaker were
distinguished from the stronger . This undoubtedly created the idea
of mutual defence, of one individual governing diverse families
reunited, and of thus defending their persons and their ﬁelds against
the invasion of an enemy; but hence LIBER TY was ruined in its
foundation, and EQUALITY disappeared.53
These words are drawn from the purported manifesto of the Secret Order of
the Illuminati, a network of revolutionary cadres or ganized within the
Freemasons by a Bavarian law professor named Adam W eishaupt. The
organization did exist in the late eighteenth century; its purpose was
apparently to educate an enlightened international, or even anti-national,
elite to work for the restoration of freedom and equality .
Conservatives almost immediately denounced the Order , leading to it
being banned in 1785, less than ten years after its foundation, but right-
wing conspiracists insisted it continued to exist, and that the Illuminati were
the hidden hands pulling the strings behind the French Revolution (or later
even the Russian). This is silly , but one reason the fantasy was possible is
that the Illuminati were perhaps the ﬁrst to propose that a revolutionary
vanguard, trained in the correct interpretation of doctrine, would be able tounderstand the overall direction of human history – and, therefore, be
capable of intervening to speed up its progress.54
It may seem ironic that Rousseau, who began his career by taking what we
would now consider an arch-conservative position – that seeming progress
leads only to moral decay – would end up becoming the supreme bête noire
of so many conservatives.55 But a special vitriol is always reserved for
traitors.
Many conservative thinkers see Rousseau as having gone full circle from
a promising start to creating what we now think of as the political left. Nor
are they entirely wrong in this. Rousseau was indeed a crucial ﬁgure in the
formation of left-wing thought. One reason intellectual debates of the mid
eighteenth century seem so strange to us nowadays is precisely that what
we understand as left/right divisions had not yet crystallized. At the time of
the American Revolution, the terms ‘left’ and ‘right’ themselves did not yet
exist. A product of the decade immediately following, they originally
referred to the respective seating positions of aristocratic and popular
factions in the French National Assembly of 1789.
Let us emphasize (we really shouldn’ t have to) that Rousseau’ s effusions
on the fundamental decency of human nature and lost ages of freedom and
equality were in no sense themselves responsible for the French Revolution.
It’s not as if he somehow caused the sans culottes  to rise up by putting such
ideas into their heads (as we’ve noted, for most of European history
intellectuals seem to have been the only class of people who weren’t
capable of imagining that other worlds might be brought into being). But
we can ar gue that, in folding together the indigenous critique and the
doctrine of progress originally developed to counter it, Rousseau did in fact
write the founding document of the left as an intellectual project.
For the same reason, right-wing thought has from the beginning been
suspicious not just about ideas of progress, but also the entire tradition that
emer ged from the indigenous critique. T oday , we assume that it is lar gely
those on the political left who speak about the ‘myth of the noble savage’,
and that any early European account that idealizes faraway people, or even
attributes to them cogent opinions, is really just a romantic projection of
European fantasies on to people the authors could never genuinely
understand. The racist denigration of the savage, and naive celebration of
savage innocence, are always treated as two sides of the same imperialistcoin.56 Yet originally this was an explicitly right-wing position, as
explained by T er Ellingson, the contemporary anthropologist who has
reviewed the subject most comprehensively . Ellingson concluded there
never was a ‘noble savage’ myth; at least not in the sense of a stereotype of
simple societies living in an age of happy primordial innocence. Rather ,
travellers’ accounts tend to supply a much more ambivalent picture,
describing alien societies as a complicated, sometimes (to them) incoherent,
mix of virtues and vices. What needs to be investigated, instead, might
better be called the ‘myth of the myth of the noble savage’: why is it that
certain Europeans began attributing such a naive position to others? The
answer isn’ t pretty . The phrase ‘noble savage’ was in fact popularized a
century or so after Rousseau, as a term of ridicule and abuse. It was
deployed by a clique of outright racists, who in 1859 – as the British
Empire reached its height of power – took over the British Ethnological
Society and called for the extermination of inferior peoples.
The original exponents of the idea blamed Rousseau, but before long
students of literary history were scouring the archives looking for traces of
the ‘noble savage’ everywhere. Almost all the texts discussed in this
chapter came under scrutiny; all were dismissed as dangerous, romantic
fantasies. At ﬁrst, however , these dismissals came from the political right.
Ellingson makes a particular example of Gilbert Chinard, whose 1913
volume L’Amérique et le rêve exotique dans la littératur e française au
XVIIe et au XVIIIe siècle  (America and the Exotic Dr eam in Fr ench
Literatur e of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries ) was primarily
responsible for establishing the notion of the ‘noble savage’ as a W estern
literary trope in American universities, since he was perhaps the least shy
about his political agenda.
Citing Lahontan as the key ﬁgure in the formation of this notion, Chinard
argued that Rousseau borrowed speciﬁc ar guments either from Lahontan’ s
Memoirs  or his Dialogues  with Kandiaronk. In a broader sense, he detects
an afﬁnity of temperament:
It is Jean-Jacques [Rousseau], more than any other author , that the
author of the Dialogues with a Savage  resembles. W ith all his faults,
his fundamentally ignoble motives, he has put into his style a
passion, an enthusiasm which has no equivalent except in the
Discourse on Inequality . Like Rousseau, he is an anarchist; like him,he is bereft of moral sensibility , and to a considerably greater
degree; like him, he imagines himself to be the prey of persecutions
of the human race leagued against himself; like him, he is indignant
about the suf ferings of the miserable and, even more than him, he
throws out the call to arms; and like him, above all, he attributes to
property all the evils that we suf fer. In this, he permits us to
establish a direct connection between the Jesuit missionaries and
Jean-Jacques.57
According to Chinard, even the Jesuits (Lahontan’ s ostensible enemies)
were ultimately playing the same game of introducing deeply subversive
notions through the back door . Their motives in quoting the exasperated
observations of their interlocutors were not innocent. Commenting directly
on the above passage, Ellingson quite reasonably asks what on earth
Chinard is actually talking about here: some kind of anarchist movement
perpetrated by Lahontan, the Jesuits and Rousseau? A conspiracy theory to
explain the French Revolution? Y es, concludes Ellingson, it almost is. The
Jesuits, according to Chinard, have promoted ‘dangerous ideas’ in giving us
the impression of the good qualities of ‘savages’, and ‘this impression
seems to have been contrary to the interests of the monarchical state and
religion.’ In fact, Chinard’ s fundamental characterization of Rousseau is as
‘un continuateur des missionaires Jésuites’, and he holds the missionaries
responsible for giving rise to ‘the revolutionary spirits [who] would
transform our society and, inﬂamed by reading their relations, bring us back
to the state of the American savages’.58
For Chinard, whether or not European observers were reporting the views
of their indigenous interlocutors accurately is irrelevant. For indigenous
Americans were, as Chinard puts it, ‘a race dif ferent from our own’ with
whom no meaningful relation was possible: one might as well, he implies,
record the political opinions of a leprechaun.59 What really matters, he
emphasizes, are the motives of the white people involved – and these
people were clearly malcontents and troublemakers. He accuses one early
observer on the customs of the Greenland Inuit of inserting a mix of
socialism and ‘illuminism’ into his descriptions – that is, viewing savage
customs through a lens that might as well have been borrowed from the
Secret Order of the Illuminati.60BEYOND THE ‘MYTH OF THE STUPID SA VAGE’ (WHY ALL
THESE THINGS MA TTER SO MUCH FOR OUR PROJECT IN
THIS BOOK)
This is not the place to document how a right-wing critique morphed into a
left-wing critique. T o some degree, one can probably just put it down to the
laziness of scholars schooled in the history of French or English literature,
faced with the prospect of having to seriously engage with what a
seventeenth-century Mi’kmaq might have actually been thinking. T o say
Mi’kmaq thought is unimportant would be racist; to say it’ s unknowable
because the sources were racist, however , does rather let one of f the hook.
To some degree, too, such reluctance to engage with indigenous sources
is based on completely legitimate protests on the part of those who have,
historically , been romanticized. Many have remarked that, to those on the
receiving end, being told you are an inferior breed and that therefore
anything you say can be ignored, and being told you are an innocent child
of nature or the embodiment of ancient wisdom, and that therefore
everything you say must be treated as inef fably profound are almost equally
annoying. Both attitudes appear designed to prevent any meaningful
conversation.
As we noted in our ﬁrst chapter , when we set out to write this book we
imagined ourselves making a contribution to the bur geoning literature on
the origins of social inequality – except this time, one based on the actual
evidence. As our research proceeded, we came to realize just how strange a
question ‘what are the origins of social inequality?’ really was. Quite apart
from the implications of primordial innocence, this way of framing the
problem suggests a certain diagnosis of what is wrong with society , and
what can and can’ t be done about it; and as we’ve seen, it often has very
little to do with what people living in those societies we’ve come to call
‘egalitarian’ actually feel makes them dif ferent from others.
Rousseau sidestepped the question by reducing his savages to mere
thought experiments. He was just about the only major ﬁgure of the French
Enlightenment who didn’ t write a dialogue or other imaginative work
attempting to look at European society from a foreign point of view . In fact,
he strips his ‘savages’ of any imaginative powers of their own; their
happiness is entirely derived from their inability to imagine things
otherwise, or to project themselves into the future in any way at all.61 Theyare thus also utterly lacking in philosophy . This is presumably why no one
could foresee the disasters that would ensue when they ﬁrst staked out
property and began to form governments to protect it; by the time human
beings were even capable of thinking that far ahead, the worst damage had
already been done.
Back in the 1960s, the French anthropologist Pierre Clastres suggested
that precisely the opposite was the case. What if the sort of people we like
to imagine as simple and innocent are free of rulers, governments,
bureaucracies, ruling classes and the like, not because they are lacking in
imagination, but because they’re actually more imaginative than we are?
We ﬁnd it difﬁcult to picture what a truly free society would be like;
perhaps they have no similar trouble picturing what arbitrary power and
domination would be like. Perhaps they can not only imagine it, but
consciously arrange their society in such a way as to avoid it. As we’ll see
in the next chapter , Clastres’ s argument has its limits. But by insisting that
the people studied by anthropologists are just as self-conscious, just as
imaginative, as the anthropologists themselves, he did more to reverse the
damage than anyone before or since.
Rousseau has been accused of many crimes. He is innocent of most of
them. If there is really a toxic element in his legacy , it is this: not his
promulgation of the image of the ‘noble savage’, which he didn’ t really do,
but his promulgation of what we might call the ‘myth of the stupid savage’
– even if one he considered blissful in its state of stupidity . Nineteenth-
century imperialists adopted the stereotype enthusiastically , merely adding
on a variety of ostensibly scientiﬁc justiﬁcations – from Darwinian
evolutionism to ‘scientiﬁc’ racism – to elaborate on that notion of innocent
simplicity , and thus provide a pretext for pushing the remaining free
peoples of the world (or increasingly , as European imperial expansion
continued, the formerly free peoples) into a conceptual space where their
judgements no longer seemed threatening. This is the work we are trying to
undo.
‘Liberty , Equality , Fraternity’ was the rallying cry of the French
Revolution.62 Today there are whole disciplines – sub-branches of
philosophy and political science and legal studies – which take ‘equality’ as
their principal subject matter . Everyone agrees that equality is a value; noone seems to agree on what the term actually refers to. Equality of
opportunity? Equality of condition? Formal equality before the law?
Similarly , societies like the seventeenth-century Mi’kmaq, Algonkians or
Wendat are regularly referred to as ‘egalitarian societies’; or , if not, then as
‘band’ or ‘tribal’ societies, which is usually presumed to mean the same
thing. It’ s never entirely clear exactly what the term is supposed to refer to.
Are we talking about an ideology , the belief that everyone in society should
be the same – obviously not in all ways, but in certain respects that are
considered particularly important? Or should it be one in which people
actually are the same? What might either of these actually mean in
practice? That all members of society have equal access to land, or treat
each other with equal dignity , or are equally free to make their opinions
known in public assemblies; or are we talking about some scale of
measurement that can be imposed by the observer: cash income, political
power , calorie intake, house size, number and quality of personal
possessions?
Would equality mean the ef facement of the individual, or the celebration
of the individual? (After all, to an outside observer , a society where
everyone was exactly the same, and one where they were all so completely
different as to preclude any sort of comparison, would seem equally
‘egalitarian’.) Can one speak of equality in a society where elders are
treated like gods and make all important decisions, if everyone in that
society who survives past, say , ﬁfty will eventually become an elder? What
about gender relations? Many societies referred to as ‘egalitarian’ are only
really egalitarian between adult men. Sometimes relations between men and
women in such societies are anything but equal. At other times things are
more ambiguous.
It may be, for instance, that men and women in a given society are not
only expected to perform dif ferent sorts of work, but hold dif ferent opinions
about why work (or what sorts of work) is important in the ﬁrst place, and
therefore feel they have a higher status; or perhaps that their respective
roles are so dif ferent, it makes no sense to compare them. Many of the
societies encountered by the French in North America ﬁt this description.
They could be seen as matriarchal from one perspective, patriarchal from
another .63 In such cases, can we speak of gender equality? Or would we
only be able to do so if men and women were also equal according to some
minimal external criterion: being equally free from the threat of domesticviolence, for example, or having equal access to resources, or equal say in
communal af fairs?
Since there is no clear and generally accepted answer to any of these
questions, use of the term ‘egalitarian’ has led to endless ar guments. In fact,
it remains entirely unclear what ‘egalitarian’ even means. Ultimately the
idea is employed not because it has any real analytical substance, but rather
for the same reason seventeenth-century natural law theorists speculated
about equality in the State of Nature: ‘equality’ is a default term, referring
to that kind of protoplasmic mass of humanity one imagines as being left
over when all the trappings of civilization are stripped away . ‘Egalitarian’
people are those without princes, judges, overseers or hereditary priests, and
usually without cities or writing, or preferably even farming. They are
societies of equals only in the sense that all the most obvious tokens of
inequality are missing.
It follows that any historical work which purports to be about the origins
of social inequality is really an inquiry into the origins of civilization; one
which in turn implies a vision of history like that of T urgot, which
conceives ‘civilization’ as a system of social complexity , guaranteeing
greater overall prosperity , but at the same time ensuring that certain
compromises will necessarily have to be made in the areas of freedom and
equality . We will be trying to write a dif ferent kind of history , which will
also require a dif ferent understanding of ‘civilization’.
To be clear , it’s not that we consider the fact that princes, judges,
overseers or hereditary priests – or for that matter , writing, cities and
farming – only emer ge at a certain point in human history to be
uninteresting or insigniﬁcant. Quite on the contrary: in order to understand
our current predicament as a species, it is absolutely crucial to understand
how these things ﬁrst came about. However , we would also insist that, in
order to do so, we should reject the impulse to treat our distant ancestors as
some sort of primordial human soup. Evidence accumulating from
archaeology , anthropology and related ﬁelds suggests that – just like
seventeenth-century Amerindians and Frenchmen – the people of
prehistoric times had very speciﬁc ideas about what was important in their
societies; that these varied considerably; and that describing such societies
as uniformly ‘egalitarian’ tells us almost nothing about them.
No doubt there was usually a degree of equality by default; an
assumption that humans are all equally powerless in the face of the gods; ora strong feeling that no one’ s will should be permanently subordinated to
another ’s. Presumably there must have been, if only to ensure that
permanent princes, judges, overseers or hereditary priests did not emer ge
for such long periods of time. But self-conscious ideas of ‘equality’, putting
equality forward as an explicit value (as opposed to an ideology of freedom,
or dignity , or participation that applies equally to all) appear to have been
relative latecomers to human history . And even when they do appear , they
rarely apply to everyone.
Ancient Athenian democracy , to take just one example, was based on
political equality among its citizens – even if these were only somewhere
between 10 and 20 per cent of the overall population – in the sense that
each had the same rights to participate in public decision-making. W e are
taught to see this notion of equal civic participation as a milestone in
political development, revived and expanded some 2,000 years later (as it
happens, the political systems labelled ‘democracies’ in nineteenth-century
Europe had almost nothing to do with ancient Athens, but this is not really
the point). What’ s more to the point is that Athenian intellectuals at the
time, who were mostly of aristocratic background, tended to consider the
whole arrangement a tawdry business, and most of them much preferred the
government of Sparta, ruled by an even smaller percentage of the total
population, who lived collectively of f the labours of serfs.
Spartan citizens, in turn, referred to themselves as the Homoioi , which
could be translated either as ‘the Equals’ or ‘Those Who Are All the Same’
– they all underwent the same rigorous military training, adopted the same
haughty disdain for both ef feminate luxuries and individual idiosyncrasies,
ate in communal mess halls and spent most of their lives practising for war .
This is not, then, a book about the origins of inequality . But it aims to
answer many of the same questions in a dif ferent way . There is no doubt
that something has gone terribly wrong with the world. A very small
percentage of its population do control the fates of almost everyone else,
and they are doing it in an increasingly disastrous fashion. T o understand
how this situation came about, we should trace the problem back to what
ﬁrst made possible the emer gence of kings, priests, overseers and judges.
But we no longer have the luxury of assuming we already know in advance
what the precise answers will turn out to be. T aking guidance fromindigenous critics like Kandiaronk, we need to approach the evidence of the
human past with fresh eyes.3
Unfreezing the Ice Age
In and out of chains: the pr otean possibilities of human politics
Most societies imagine a mythic age of creation. Once upon a time, the
story goes, the world was dif ferent: ﬁsh and birds could talk, animals could
turn into humans and humans into animals. It was possible, in such a time,
for things to come into being that were entirely new , in a way that cannot
really happen any more: ﬁre, or cooking, or the institution of marriage, or
the keeping of pets. In these lesser days, we are reduced to endlessly
repeating the great gestures of that time: lighting our own particular ﬁres,
arranging our own particular marriages, feeding our particular pets –
without ever being able to change the world in quite the same way .
In some ways, accounts of ‘human origins’ play a similar role for us
today as myth did for ancient Greeks or Polynesians, or the Dreamtime for
indigenous Australians. This is not to cast aspersions on the scientiﬁc rigour
or value of these accounts. It is simply to observe that the two fulﬁl
somewhat similar functions. If we think on a scale of, say , the last 3 million
years, there actually was an age in which the lines between (what we today
think of as) human and animal were still indistinct; and when someone,
after all, did have to light a ﬁre, cook a meal or perform a marriage
ceremony for the ﬁrst time. W e know these things happened. Still, we really
don’t know how . It is very difﬁcult to resist the temptation to make up
stories about what might have happened: stories which necessarily reﬂect
our own fears, desires, obsessions and concerns. As a result, such distant
times can become a vast canvas for the working out of our collective
fantasies.
This canvas of human prehistory is distinctively modern. The renowned
theorist of culture W . J. T . Mitchell once remarked that dinosaurs are thequintessential modernist animal, since in Shakespeare’ s time no one knew
such creatures had ever existed. In a similar way , until quite recently most
Christians assumed anything worth knowing about early humans could be
found in the Book of Genesis. Up until the early years of the nineteenth
century , ‘men of letters’ – scientists included – still lar gely assumed that the
universe did not even exist prior to late October , 4004 BC, and that all
humans spoke the same language (Hebrew) until the dispersal of humanity ,
after the fall of the T ower of Babel sixteen centuries later .1
At that time there was as yet no ‘prehistory’. There was only history ,
even if some of that history was wildly wrong. The term ‘prehistory’ only
came into common use after the discoveries at Brixham Cave in Devon in
1858, when stone axes, which could only have been fashioned by humans,
were found alongside remains of cave bear , woolly rhinoceros and other
extinct species, all together under a sealed casing of rock. This, and
subsequent archaeological ﬁndings, sparked a complete rethinking of
existing evidence. Suddenly , ‘the bottom dropped out of human history .’2
The problem is that prehistory turns out to be an extremely long period of
time: more than 3 million years, during which we know our ancestors were,
at least sometimes, using stone tools. For most of this period, evidence is
extremely limited. There are phases of literally thousands of years for
which the only evidence of hominin activity we possess is a single tooth,
and perhaps a handful of pieces of shaped ﬂint. While the technology we
are capable of bringing to bear on such remote periods improves
dramatically each decade, there’ s only so much you can do with sparse
material. As a result, it’ s difﬁcult to resist the temptation to ﬁll in the gaps,
to claim we know more than we really do. When scientists do this the
results often bear a suspicious resemblance to those very biblical narratives
modern science is supposed to have cast aside.
Let’s take just one example. Back in the 1980s, there was a great deal of
buzz about a ‘mitochondrial Eve’, the putative common ancestor of our
entire species. Granted, no one was claiming to have actually found the
physical remains of such an ancestor; but sequencing the DNA in
mitochondria – the tiny cell-motors we inherit from our mothers –
demonstrated that such an Eve must have existed, perhaps as recently as
120,000 years ago. And while no one imagined we’d ever ﬁnd Eve herself,
the discovery of a variety of other fossil skulls rescued from the East
African Rift V alley (a natural ‘preservation trap’ for Palaeolithic remains,long since swept to oblivion in more exposed settings) seemed to provide a
suggestion as to what Eve might have looked like and where she might have
lived. While scientists continued debating the ins and outs, popular
magazines were soon carrying stories about a modern counterpart to the
Garden of Eden, the original incubator of humanity , the savannah-womb
that gave life to us all.
Many of us probably still have something resembling this picture of
human origins in our mind. More recent research, though, has shown it
couldn’ t possibly be accurate. In fact, biological anthropologists and
geneticists are now conver ging on an entirely dif ferent picture. Rather than
everyone starting out the same, then dispersing from East Africa in some
Tower -of-Babel moment to become the diverse nations and peoples of the
earth, early human populations in Africa appear to have been far more
physically diverse than anything we are familiar with today .
We modern-day humans tend to exaggerate our dif ferences. The results
of such exaggeration are often catastrophic. Between war , slavery ,
imperialism and sheer day-to-day racist oppression, the last several
centuries have seen so much human suf fering justiﬁed by minor dif ferences
in human appearance that we can easily for get just how minor these
differences really are. By any biologically meaningful standard, living
humans are barely distinguishable. Whether you go to Bosnia, Japan,
Rwanda or the Bafﬁn Islands, you can expect to see people with the same
small and gracile faces, chin, globular skull and roughly the same
distribution of body hair . Not only do we look the same, in many ways we
act the same as well (for instance, everywhere from the Australian outback
to Amazonia, rolling one’ s eyes is a way of saying ‘what an idiot!’). The
same applies to cognition. W e might think dif ferent groups of humans
realize their cognitive capacities in very dif ferent ways – and to some
extent, of course, we do – but again, much of this perceived dif ference
results from our having no real basis for comparison: there’ s no human
language, for instance, that doesn’ t have nouns, verbs and adjectives; and
while humans may enjoy very dif ferent forms of music and dance, there’ s
no known human population that does not enjoy music and dancing at all.
Rewind a few hundred millennia and all this was most deﬁnitely not the
case.
For most of our evolutionary history , we did indeed live in Africa – but
not just the eastern savannahs, as previously thought: our biologicalancestors were distributed everywhere from Morocco to the Cape.3 Some
of those populations remained isolated from each another for tens or even
hundreds of thousands of years, cut of f from their nearest relatives by
deserts and rainforests. Strong regional traits developed.4 The result
probably would have struck a modern observer as something more akin to a
world inhabited by hobbits, giants and elves than anything we have direct
experience of today , or in the more recent past. Those elements that make
up modern humans – the relatively uniform ‘us’ referred to above – seem
only to have come together quite late in the process. In other words, if we
think humans are dif ferent from each other now , it’s largely illusory; and
even such dif ferences as do exist are utterly trivial and cosmetic, compared
with what must have been happening in Africa during most of prehistory .
Ancestral humans were not only quite dif ferent from each other; they
also coexisted with smaller -brained, more ape-like species such as Homo
naledi . What were these ancestral societies like? At this point, at least, we
should be honest and admit that, for the most part, we don’ t have the
slightest idea. There’ s only so much you can reconstruct from cranial
remains and the occasional piece of knapped ﬂint – which is basically all
we have. Most of the time we don’ t even really know what was going on
below the neck, let alone with pigmentation, diet or anything else. What we
do know is that we are composite products of this original mosaic of human
populations, which interacted with one another , interbred, drifted apart and
came together mostly in ways we can still only guess at.5 It seems
reasonable to assume that behaviours like mating and child-rearing
practices, the presence or absence of dominance hierarchies or forms of
language and proto-language must have varied at least as much as physical
types, and probably far more.
Perhaps the only thing we can say with real certainty is that, in terms of
ancestry , we are all Africans.
Modern humans ﬁrst appeared in Africa. When they began expanding out
of Africa into Eurasia, they encountered other populations such as
Neanderthals and Denisovans – less dif ferent, but still different – and these
various groups interbred.6 Only after those other populations became
extinct can we really begin talking about a single, human ‘us’ inhabiting the
planet. What all this brings home is just how radically dif ferent the social
and even physical world of our remote ancestors would have seemed to us –
and this would have been true at least down to around 40,000 BC. The rangeof ﬂora and fauna surrounding them was quite unlike anything that exists
today . All of which makes it extremely difﬁcult to draw analogies. There’ s
simply nothing in the historical or ethnographic record that resembles a
situation in which dif ferent subspecies of human interbred, interacted, co-
operated, but sometimes also killed each other – and even if there were, the
archaeological evidence is too thin and sporadic to test whether remote
prehistory was really anything like that or not.7
The only thing we can reasonably infer about social or ganization among
our earliest ancestors is that it’ s likely to have been extraordinarily diverse.
Early humans inhabited a wide range of natural environments, from
coastlands and tropical forest to mountains and savannah. They were far , far
more physically diverse than humans are today; and presumably their social
differences were even greater than their physical ones. In other words, there
is no ‘original’ form of human society . Searching for one can only be a
matter of myth-making, whether the resultant myths take the form of ‘killer
ape’ fantasies that emer ged in the 1960s, seared into collective
consciousness by movies like Stanley Kubrick’ s 2001: A Space Odyssey ; or
the ‘aquatic ape’; or even the highly amusing but fanciful ‘stoned ape’ (the
theory that consciousness emer ged from the accidental ingestion of
psychedelic mushrooms). Myths like these entertain Y ouTube watchers to
this day .
We should be clear: there’ s nothing wrong with myths. Likely as not, the
tendency to make up stories about the distant past as a way of reﬂecting on
the nature of our species is itself, like art and poetry , one of those distinctly
human traits that began to crystallize in deep prehistory . And no doubt some
of these stories – for instance, feminist theories that see distinctly human
sociability as originating in collective child-rearing practices – can indeed
tell us something important about the paths that conver ged in modern
humanity .8 But such insights can only ever be partial because there was no
Garden of Eden, and a single Eve never existed.
WHY THE ‘SAPIENT P ARADOX’ IS A RED HERRING; AS SOON
AS WE WERE HUMAN, WE ST ARTED DOING HUMAN THINGS
Human beings, today , are a fairly uniform species. This uniformity is not, in
evolutionary terms, particularly old. Its genetic basis was established
around half a million years ago, but it is almost certainly misguided to thinkwe could ever specify a single, more recent point in time when Homo
sapiens  ‘emer ged’ – that is, when all the various elements of the modern
human condition conver ged, deﬁnitively , in some stupendous moment of
creation.
Consider the ﬁrst direct evidence of what we’d now call complex
symbolic human behaviour , or simply ‘culture’. Currently , it dates back no
more than 100,000 years. Where exactly on the African continent this
evidence for culture crops up is determined lar gely by conditions of
preservation, and by the countries that have so far been most accessible for
archaeological investigation. Rock shelters around the coastlands of South
Africa are a key source, trapping prehistoric sediments that yield evidence
of hafted tools and the expressive use of shell and ochre around 80,000
BC.9 Comparably ancient ﬁnds are also known from other parts of Africa,
but it’ s not until later , around 45,000 years ago – by which time our species
was busily colonizing Eurasia – that similar evidence starts appearing much
more widely , and in greater quantities.
In the 1980s and 1990s it was widely assumed that something profound
happened, some kind of sudden creative efﬂorescence, around 45,000 years
ago, variously referred to in the literature as the ‘Upper Palaeolithic
Revolution’ or even the ‘Human Revolution’.10 But in the last two decades
it has become increasingly clear to researchers that this is most likely an
illusion, created by biases in our evidence.
Here’ s why . Much of the evidence for this ‘revolution’ is restricted to a
single part of the world: Europe, where it is associated with replacement of
Neanderthals by Homo sapiens  around 40,000 BC. It includes more
advanced toolkits for hunting and handicrafts, the ﬁrst clear evidence for
the making of images in bone, ivory and clay – including the famous
sculpted ‘female ﬁgurines’,1 1 dense clusters of carved and painted animal
ﬁgures in caves, often observed with breathtaking accuracy; more elaborate
ways of clothing and decorating the human body; the ﬁrst attested use of
musical instruments like bone ﬂutes; regular exchange of raw materials
over great distances, and also what are usually taken as the earliest proofs
of social inequality , in the form of grand burials.
All this is impressive, and gives the impression of a lack of synchrony
between the ticking of our genetic and cultural clocks. It seems to ask the
question: why do so many tens of thousands of years stand between the
biological origins of humanity and the widespread appearance of typicallyhuman forms of behaviour; between when we became capable of creating
culture and when we ﬁnally got round to doing it? What were we actually
doing in the interim? Many researchers have puzzled over this and have
even coined a phrase for it: ‘the sapient paradox’.12 A few go so far as to
postulate some late mutation in the human brain to explain the apparently
superior cultural capacities of Upper Palaeolithic Europeans, but such views
can no longer be taken seriously .
In fact, it’ s becoming increasingly clear that the whole problem is a
mirage. The reason archaeological evidence from Europe is so rich is that
European governments tend to be rich; and that European professional
institutions, learned societies and university departments have been
pursuing prehistory far longer on their own doorstep than in other parts of
the world. W ith each year that passes, new evidence accumulates for early
behavioural complexity elsewhere: not just Africa, but also the Arabian
Peninsula, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.13 Even as we write,
a cave site on the coast of Kenya called Panga ya Saidi is yielding evidence
of shell beads and worked pigments stretching back 60,000 years;14 and
research on the islands of Borneo and Sulawesi is opening vistas on to an
unsuspected world of cave art, many thousands of years older than the
famous images of Lascaux and Altamira, on the other side of Eurasia.15 No
doubt still earlier examples of complex pictorial art will one day be found
somewhere on the continent of Africa.
If anything, then, Europe was late to the party . Even after its initial
colonization by modern humans – starting around 45,000 BC – the continent
was still thinly populated, and the new arrivals coexisted there, albeit fairly
brieﬂy , with more established Neanderthal populations (themselves engaged
in complex cultural activities of various sorts).16 Why there appears to be
such a sudden cultural efﬂorescence, shortly after their arrival, may have
something to do with climate and demography . To put it bluntly: with the
movement of the ice sheets, human populations in Europe were living in
harsher and more conﬁned spaces than our species had encountered before.
Game-rich valleys and steppe were bounded by tundra to the north and
dense coastal forests to the south. W e have to picture our ancestors moving
between relatively enclosed environments, dispersing and gathering,
tracking the seasonal movements of mammoth, bison and deer herds. While
the absolute number of people may still have been startlingly small,17 the
density of human interactions seems to have radically increased, especiallyat certain times of year . And with this came remarkable bursts of cultural
expression.18
WHY EVEN VER Y SOPHISTICA TED RESEARCHERS STILL
FIND W AYS T O CLING T O THE IDEA THA T SOCIAL
INEQUALITY HAS AN ‘ORIGIN’
As we will see in a moment, the societies that resulted in what
archaeologists call the Upper Palaeolithic period (roughly 50,000–15,000
BC) – with their ‘princely’ burials and grand communal buildings – seem to
completely defy our image of a world made up of tiny egalitarian forager
bands. The disconnect is so profound that some archaeologists have begun
taking the opposite tack, describing Ice Age Europe as populated by
‘hierarchical’ or even ‘stratiﬁed’ societies. In this, they make common
cause with evolutionary psychologists who insist that dominance behaviour
is hardwired in our genes, so much so that the moment society goes beyond
tiny bands, it must necessarily take the form of some ruling over others.
Almost everyone who isn’ t a Pleistocene archaeologist – that is, who is
not forced to confront the evidence – simply ignores it and carries on
exactly as they had before, writing as if hunter -gatherers can be assumed to
have lived in a state of primordial innocence. As Christopher Boehm puts it,
we seem doomed to play out an endless recycling of the war between
‘Hobbesian hawks and Rousseauian doves’: those who view humans as
either innately hierarchical or innately egalitarian.
Boehm’ s own work is revealing in this regard. An evolutionary
anthropologist and a specialist in primate studies, he ar gues that while
humans do have an instinctual tendency to engage in dominance-submissive
behaviour , no doubt inherited from our simian ancestors, what makes
societies distinctively human is our ability to make the conscious decision
not to act that way . Carefully working through ethnographic accounts of
existing egalitarian foraging bands in Africa, South America and Southeast
Asia, Boehm identiﬁes a whole panoply of tactics collectively employed to
bring would-be braggarts and bullies down to earth – ridicule, shame,
shunning (and in the case of inveterate sociopaths, sometimes even outright
assassination)19 – none of which have any parallel among other primates.
For instance, while gorillas do not mock each other for beating their
chests, humans do so regularly . Even more strikingly , while the bullyingbehaviour might well be instinctual, counter -bullying is not: it’ s a well-
thought-out strategy , and forager societies who engage in it display what
Boehm calls ‘actuarial intelligence’. That’ s to say , they understand what
their society might look like if they did things dif ferently: if, for instance,
skilled hunters were not systematically belittled, or if elephant meat was not
portioned out to the group by someone chosen at random (as opposed to the
person who actually killed the beast). This, he concludes, is the essence of
politics: the ability to reﬂect consciously on dif ferent directions one’ s
society could take, and to make explicit ar guments why it should take one
path rather than another . In this sense, one could say Aristotle was right
when he described human beings as ‘political animals’ – since this is
precisely what other primates never do, at least not to our knowledge.
This is a brilliant and important ar gument – but, like so many authors,
Boehm seems strangely reluctant to consider its full implications. Let’ s do
so now .
If the very essence of our humanity consists of the fact that we are self-
conscious political actors, and therefore capable of embracing a wide range
of social arrangements, would that not mean human beings should actually
have explored a wide range of social arrangements over the greater part of
our history? In the end, confusingly , Boehm assumes that all human beings
until very recently chose instead to follow exactly the same arrangements –
we were strictly ‘egalitarian for thousands of generations before
hierarchical societies began to appear ’ – thereby casually tossing early
humans back into the Garden of Eden once again. Only with the beginnings
of agriculture, he suggests, did we all collectively ﬂip back to hierarchy .
Before 12,000 years ago, Boehm insists, humans were basically egalitarian,
living in what he calls ‘societies of equals, and outside the family there
were no dominators’.20
So, according to Boehm, for about 200,000 years political animals all
chose to live just one way; then, of course, they began to rush headlong into
their chains, and ape-like dominance patterns re-emer ged. The solution to
the battle between ‘Hobbesian hawks and Rousseauian doves’ turns out to
be: our genetic nature is Hobbesian, but our political history is pretty much
exactly as described by Rousseau. The result? An odd insistence that for
many tens of thousands of years, nothing happened. This is an unsettling
conclusion, especially when we consider some of the actual archaeological
evidence for the existence of ‘Palaeolithic politics’.IN WHICH WE OBSER VE HOW GRAND MONUMENTS,
PRINCEL Y BURIALS AND OTHER UNEXPECTED FEA TURES
OF ICE AGE SOCIETIES HA VE UPENDED OUR ASSUMPTIONS
OF WHA T HUNTER-GA THERERS ARE LIKE, AND CONSIDER
WHA T IT MIGHT MEAN T O SA Y THERE W AS ‘SOCIAL
STRA TIFICA TION’ SOME 30,000 YEARS AGO
Let’s start with rich hunter -gatherer burials. Examples can be found across
much of western Eurasia, from the Dordogne to the Don. They include
discoveries in rock shelters and open-air settlements. Some of the earliest
come from sites like Sunghir in northern Russia and Dolní Věstonice in the
Moravian basin, south of Brno, and date from between 34,000 and 26,000
years ago. What we ﬁnd here are not cemeteries but isolated burials of
individuals or small groups, their bodies often placed in striking postures
and decorated – in some cases, almost saturated – with ornaments. In the
case of Sunghir that meant many thousands of beads, laboriously worked
from mammoth ivory and fox teeth. Originally , such beads would have
decorated clothing made of fur and animal skins. Some of the most lavish
costumes are from the conjoined burials of two boys, ﬂanked by great
lances made of straightened mammoth tusks.21
At Dolní Věstonice, one triple burial contains two young men with
elaborate headdresses, posed either side of an older man, all lying on a bed
of soil stained red with ochre.22 Of similar antiquity is a group of cave
burials unearthed on the coast of Liguria, near the modern border between
Italy and France. Complete bodies of young or adult men, including one
especially lavish interment known to archaeologists as Il Principe  (‘the
Prince’), were laid out in striking poses and suf fused with jewellery ,
including beads made of marine shell and deer canines, as well as blades of
exotic ﬂint. Il Principe  bears that name because he’ s also buried with what
looks to the modern eye like royal regalia: a ﬂint sceptre, elk antler batons
and an ornate headdress lovingly fashioned from perforated shells and deer
teeth. Moving further west, to the Dordogne, we encounter a 16,000-year -
old burial of a young woman, the so-called ‘Lady of Saint-Germain-de-la-
Rivière’, which contains a rich assemblage of stomach and pelvic
ornaments made of shell and stag teeth. The teeth are taken from deer
hunted in the Spanish Basque country 190 miles away .23Such ﬁndings have completely altered the specialist view of human
societies in prehistory . The pendulum has swung so far away from the old
notion of egalitarian bands that some archaeologists now ar gue that,
thousands of years before the origins of farming, human societies were
already divided along lines of status, class and inherited power . As we’ll
see, this is highly unlikely , but the evidence these archaeologists point to is
real enough: for instance, the extraordinary outlays of labour involved in
making grave goods (10,000 work hours for the Sunghir beads alone, by
some estimates); the highly advanced and standardized methods of
production, possibly suggesting specialized craftspeople; or the way in
which exotic, prestigious materials were transported from very distant
locations; and, most suggestive of all, a few cases where such wealth was
buried with children, maybe implying some kind of inherited status.24
Another unexpected result of recent archaeological research, causing
many to revise their view of prehistoric hunter -gatherers, is the appearance
of monumental architecture. In Eurasia, the most famous examples are the
stone temples of the Germuş Mountains, overlooking the Harran Plain in
southeast T urkey . In the 1990s, German archaeologists, working on the
plain’ s northern frontier , began uncovering extremely ancient remains at a
place known locally as Göbekli T epe.25 What they found has since come to
be regarded as an evolutionary conundrum. The main source of puzzlement
is a group of twenty megalithic enclosures, initially raised there around
9000 BC, and then repeatedly modiﬁed over many centuries. These
enclosures were established at a time when the surrounding plain was a
mixture of woodland and steppe, teeming with wild plant and animal
species that colonized the Middle East as the last Ice Age was drawing to a
close.
The enclosures at Göbekli T epe are massive. They comprise great T -
shaped pillars, some over sixteen feet high and weighing up to a ton, which
were hewn from the site’ s limestone bedrock or nearby quarries. The pillars,
at least 200 in total, were raised into sockets and linked by walls of rough
stone. Each is a unique work of sculpture, carved with images from the
world of dangerous carnivores and poisonous reptiles, as well as game
species, waterfowl and small scavengers. Animal forms project from the
rock in varying depths of relief: some hover coyly on the surface, others
emer ge boldly into three dimensions. These often nightmarish creatures
follow diver gent orientations, some marching to the horizon, othersworking their way down into the earth. In places, the pillar itself becomes a
sort of standing body , with human-like limbs and clothing.
The creation of these remarkable buildings implies strictly co-ordinated
activity on a really lar ge scale, even more so if multiple enclosures were
constructed simultaneously , according to an overall plan (a current point of
debate).26 But the lar ger question remains: who made them? While groups
of humans not too far away had already begun cultivating crops at the time,
to the best of our knowledge those who built Göbekli T epe had not. Y es,
they harvested and processed wild cereals and other plants in season, but
there is no compelling reason to see them as ‘proto-farmers’, or to suggest
they had any interest in orienting their livelihoods around the domestication
of crops. Indeed, there was no particular reason why they should, given the
availability of fruits, berries, nuts and edible wild fauna in their vicinity . (In
fact, there are good reasons to think the builders of Göbekli T epe were
different, in some quite startling ways, from nearby groups who were
beginning to take up farming, but this will have to wait for a later chapter;
for the moment, we’re just interested in the monuments.)
To some, the raised location and orientation of the buildings at Göbekli
Tepe suggest an astronomical or chronometric function, each chain of
pillars aligned with a particular cycle of celestial movements.
Archaeologists remain sceptical, pointing out that the structures may once
have been roofed, and that their layout was subject to many alterations over
time. But what has mostly intrigued scholars of dif ferent disciplines so far
is something else: the apparent proof they of fer that ‘hunter -gatherer
societies had evolved institutions to support major public works, projects,
and monumental constructions, and thus had a complex social hierarchy
prior to their adoption of farming.’27 Again, matters are not so simple,
because these two phenomena – hierarchy and the measure of time – were
closely interwoven.
While Göbekli T epe is often presented as an anomaly , there is in fact a great
deal of evidence for monumental construction of dif ferent sorts among
hunter -gatherers in earlier periods, extending back into the Ice Age.
In Europe, between 25,000 and 12,000 years ago public works were
already a feature of human habitation across an area reaching from Kraków
to Kiev . Along this transect of the glacial fringe, remains of impressive
circular structures have been found that are clearly distinguishable fromordinary camp-dwellings in their scale (the lar gest were over thirty-nine feet
in diameter), permanence, aesthetic qualities and prominent locations in the
Pleistocene landscape. Each was erected on a framework made of
mammoth tusks and bones, taken from many tens of these great animals,
which were arranged in alternating sequences and patterns that go beyond
the merely functional to produce structures that would have looked quite
striking to our eyes, and magniﬁcent indeed to people at the time. Great
wooden enclosures of up to 130 feet in length also existed, of which only
the post-holes and sunken ﬂoors remain.28 Göbekli T epe too is likely to
have had its wooden counterparts.
Monumentality is always to some degree a relative concept; that’ s to say ,
a building or structure is ‘monumental’ only in comparison to other
buildings and structures a viewer has actually experienced. Obviously , the
Ice Age produced nothing on the scale of the Pyramids of Giza or the
Roman Colosseum – but, by the standards of their day , the kind of
structures we’ve been describing can only have been considered public
works, involving sophisticated design and the co-ordination of labour on an
impressive scale. Research at the Russian site of Y udinovo suggests that
‘mammoth houses’, as they are often called, were not in fact dwellings at
all, but monuments in the strict sense: carefully planned and constructed to
commemorate the completion of a great mammoth hunt (and the solidarity
of the extended hunting group), using whatever durable parts remained once
carcasses had been processed for their meat and hides; and later covered
with sediment to create a durable marker in the landscape.29 We are talking
here about really staggering quantities of meat: for each structure (there
were ﬁve at Y udinovo), there was enough mammoth to feed hundreds of
people for around three months.30 Open-air settlements like Y udinovo,
Mezhirich and Kostenki, where such mammoth monuments were erected,
often became central places whose inhabitants exchanged amber , marine
shells and animal pelts over impressive distances.
So what are we to make of all this evidence for stone temples, princely
burials, mammoth monuments and bustling centres of trade and craft
production, stretching back far into the Ice Age? What are they doing there,
in a Palaeolithic world where – at least on some accounts – nothing much is
ever supposed to have happened, and human societies can best be
understood by analogy with troops of chimps or bonobos? Unsurprisingly ,
perhaps, some have responded by completely abandoning the idea of anegalitarian Golden Age, concluding instead that this must have been a
society dominated by powerful leaders, even dynasties – and, therefore, that
self-aggrandizement and coercive power have always been the enduring
forces behind human social evolution. But this doesn’ t really work either .
Evidence of institutional inequality in Ice Age societies, whether grand
burials or monumental buildings, is sporadic. Richly costumed burials
appear centuries, and often hundreds of miles, apart. Even if we put this
down to the patchiness of the evidence, we still have to ask why the
evidence is so patchy in the ﬁrst place: after all, if any of these Ice Age
‘princes’ had behaved like, say , Bronze Age (let alone Renaissance Italian)
princes, we’d also be ﬁnding all the usual trappings of centralized power:
fortiﬁcations, storehouses, palaces. Instead, over tens of thousands of years,
we see monuments and magniﬁcent burials, but little else to indicate the
growth of ranked societies, let alone anything remotely resembling ‘states’.
To understand why the early record of human social life is patterned in this
strange, staccato fashion we ﬁrst have to do away with some lingering
preconceptions about ‘primitive’ mentalities.
IN WHICH WE DISPOSE OF LINGERING ASSUMPTIONS THA T
‘PRIMITIVE’ FOLK WERE SOMEHOW INCAP ABLE OF
CONSCIOUS REFLECTION, AND DRA W ATTENTION T O THE
HIST ORICAL IMPOR TANCE OF ECCENTRICITY
In the last chapter , we suggested that the really insidious element of
Rousseau’ s legacy is not so much the idea of the ‘noble savage’ as that of
the ‘stupid savage’. W e may have got over the overt racism of most
nineteenth-century Europeans, or at least we think we have, but it’ s not
unusual to ﬁnd even very sophisticated contemporary thinkers who feel it’ s
more appropriate to compare ‘bands’ of hunter -gatherers with chimps or
baboons than with anyone they’d ever be likely to meet. Consider the
following passage from the historian Y uval Noah Harari’ s Sapiens: A Brief
History of Humankind  (2014). Harari starts of f with a perfectly reasonable
observation: that our knowledge of early human history is extremely
limited, and social arrangements probably varied a great deal from place to
place. T rue, he overstates his case (he suggests we can really know nothing,
even about the Ice Age), but the basic point is well taken. Then we get this:The sociopolitical world of the foragers is another area about which
we know next to nothing … scholars cannot even agree on the
basics, such as the existence of private property , nuclear families
and monogamous relationships. It’ s likely that dif ferent bands had
different structures. Some may have been as hierarchical, tense and
violent as the nastiest chimpanzee group, while others were as laid-
back, peaceful and lascivious as a bunch of bonobos.
So not only was everyone living in bands until farming came along, but
these bands were basically ape-like in character . If this seems unfair to the
author , remember that Harari could just as easily have written ‘as tense and
violent as the nastiest biker gang’, and ‘as laid-back, peaceful and
lascivious as a hippie commune’. One might have imagined the obvious
thing to compare one group of human beings with would be … another
group of human beings. Why , then, did Harari choose chimps instead of
bikers? It’ s hard to escape the impression that the main point of dif ference
is that bikers choose  to live the way they do. Such choices imply political
consciousness: the ability to ar gue and reﬂect about the proper way to live –
which is precisely , as Boehm reminds us, what apes don’ t do. Y et Harari,
like so many others, chooses to compare early humans with apes anyway .
In this way , the ‘sapient paradox’ returns. Not as something real, but as a
side ef fect of the weird way we read the evidence: insisting either that for
countless millennia we had modern brains, but for some reason decided to
live like monkeys anyway; or that we had the ability to overcome our
simian instincts and or ganize ourselves in an endless variety of ways, but
for some equally obscure reason only ever chose one way to or ganize
ourselves.
Perhaps the real question here is what it means to be a ‘self-conscious
political actor ’. Philosophers tend to deﬁne human consciousness in terms
of self-awareness; neuroscientists, on the other hand, tell us we spend the
overwhelming majority of our time ef fectively on autopilot, working out
habitual forms of behaviour without any sort of conscious reﬂection. When
we are capable of self-awareness, it’ s usually for very brief periods of time:
the ‘window of consciousness’, during which we can hold a thought or
work out a problem, tends to be open on average for roughly seven seconds.
What neuroscientists (and it must be said, most contemporary philosophers)
almost never notice, however , is that the great exception to this is whenwe’re talking to someone else. In conversation, we can hold thoughts and
reﬂect on problems sometimes for hours on end. This is of course why so
often, even if we’re trying to ﬁgure something out by ourselves, we imagine
arguing with or explaining it to someone else. Human thought is inherently
dialogic. Ancient philosophers tended to be keenly aware of all this: that’ s
why, whether they were in China, India or Greece, they tended to write their
books in the form of dialogues. Humans were only fully self-conscious
when ar guing with one another , trying to sway each other ’s views, or
working out a common problem. T rue individual self-consciousness,
meanwhile, was imagined as something that a few wise sages could perhaps
achieve through long study , exercise, discipline and meditation.
What we’d now call political consciousness was always assumed to come
ﬁrst. In this sense, the W estern philosophical tradition has taken a rather
unusual direction over the last few centuries. Around the same time as it
abandoned dialogue as its typical mode of writing, it also began imagining
the isolated, rational, self-conscious individual not as a rare achievement,
something typically accomplished – if at all – after literally years of living
isolated in a cave or monastic cell, or on top of a pillar in a desert
somewhere, but as the normal default state of human beings anywhere.
Even stranger , over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
it was political  self-consciousness that European philosophers came to see
as some kind of amazing historical achievement: as a phenomenon which
only really became possible with the Enlightenment itself, and the
subsequent American and French Revolutions. Before that, it was assumed,
people blindly followed traditions, or what they assumed to be the will of
God. Even when peasants or popular rebels rose up to try to overthrow
oppressive regimes they couldn’ t admit they were doing so, but convinced
themselves they were restoring ‘ancient customs’ or acting on some kind of
divine inspiration. T o Victorian intellectuals, the notion of people self-
consciously imagining a social order more to their liking and then trying to
bring it into being was simply not applicable before the modern age – and
most were deeply divided as to whether it would even be a good idea in
their own time.
All this would have come as a great surprise to Kandiaronk, the
seventeenth-century W endat philosopher -statesman whose impact on
European political thought we discussed in the previous chapter . Like many
North American peoples of his time, Kandiaronk’ s Wendat nation saw theirsociety as a confederation created by conscious agreement; agreements
open to continual renegotiation. But by the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, many in Europe and America had reached the point of
arguing that someone like Kandiaronk could never have really existed in the
ﬁrst place. ‘Primitive’ folk, they ar gued, were not only incapable of political
self-consciousness, they were not even capable of fully conscious thought
on the individual level – or at least conscious thought worthy of the name.
That is, just as they pretended a ‘rational W estern individual’ (say , a British
train guard or French colonial ofﬁcial) could be assumed to be fully self-
aware all the time (a clearly absurd assumption), they ar gued that anyone
classiﬁed as a ‘primitive’ or ‘savage’ operated with a ‘pre-logical
mentality’, or lived in a mythological dreamworld. At best, they were
mindless conformists, bound in the shackles of tradition; at worst, they were
incapable of fully conscious, critical thought of any kind.
Such theories might be considered the high-water mark of the reaction
against the indigenous critique of European society . The ar guments
attributed to ﬁgures like Kandiaronk could be written of f as simple
projections of W estern ‘noble savage’ fantasies, because real savages were
assumed to live in an entirely dif ferent mental universe. Nowadays no
reputable scholar would make such claims: everyone at least pays lip
service to the psychic unity of mankind. But in practice, as we’ve seen,
little has changed. Scholars still write as if those living in earlier stages of
economic development, and especially those who are classiﬁed as
‘egalitarian’, can be treated as if they were literally all the same, living in
some collective group-think: if human dif ferences show up in any form –
different ‘bands’ being dif ferent from each other – it is only in the same
way that bands of great apes might dif fer. Political self-consciousness, or
certainly anything we’d now call visionary politics, would have been
impossible.
And if certain hunter -gatherers turn out not to have been living
perpetually in ‘bands’ at all, but instead congregating to create grand
landscape monuments, storing lar ge quantities of preserved food and
treating particular individuals like royalty , contemporary scholars are at best
likely to place them in a new stage of development: they have moved up the
scale from ‘simple’ to ‘complex’ hunter -gatherers, a step closer to
agriculture and urban civilization. But they are still caught in the same
Turgot-like evolutionary straitjacket, their place in history deﬁned by theirmode of subsistence, and their role blindly to enact some abstract law of
development which we understand but they do not; certainly , it rarely
occurs to anyone to ask what sort of worlds they thought  they were trying to
create.31
Now , admittedly , there have always been exceptions to this rule.
Anthropologists who spend years talking to indigenous people in their own
languages, and watching them ar gue with one another , tend to be well
aware that even those who make their living hunting elephants or gathering
lotus buds are just as sceptical, imaginative, thoughtful and capable of
critical analysis as those who make their living by operating tractors,
managing restaurants or chairing university departments. A few , such as the
early-twentieth-century scholar Paul Radin in his 1927 book Primitive Man
as Philosopher , ended up concluding that at least those he knew best –
Winnebago and other Native North Americans – were actually , on average,
rather more thoughtful.
Radin himself was considered something of an oddball by his
contemporaries (he always avoided getting a proper academic job; the
legend in Chicago was that when once given a teaching fellowship there, he
was so intimidated before his ﬁrst lecture that he immediately marched out
to a nearby highway and contrived to get his leg broken by a car , then spent
the rest of the term happily reading in the hospital). Perhaps not
coincidentally , what really struck him about the ‘primitive’ societies he was
most familiar with was their tolerance of eccentricity . This, he concluded,
was simply the logical extension of that same rejection of coercion that so
impressed the Jesuits in Quebec. If, he noted, a W innebago decided that
gods or spirits did not really exist and refused to perform rituals meant to
appease them, or even if he declared the collective wisdom of the elders
wrong and invented his own personal cosmology (and both these things did,
quite regularly , happen), such a sceptic would deﬁnitely be made fun of,
while his closest friends and family might worry lest the gods punish him in
some way . However , it would never occur to them  to punish him, or that
anyone should try to force him into conformity – for instance, by blaming
him for a bad hunt and therefore refusing to share food with him until he
agreed to perform the usual rituals.
There is every reason to believe that sceptics and non-conformists exist
in every human society; what varies is how others react to them.32 Radinwas interested in the intellectual consequences, the kind of speculative
systems of thought such out-of-sync characters might create. Others have
noted the political implications. It’ s often people who are just slightly odd
who become leaders; the truly odd can become spiritual ﬁgures, but, even
more, they can and often do serve as a kind of reserve of potential talent
and insight that can be called on in the event of a crisis or unprecedented
turn of af fairs. Thomas Beidelman, for instance, observes that among the
early-twentieth-century Nuer – a cattle-keeping people of South Sudan,
famous for their rejection of anything that resembled government – there
were politicians and village ‘bulls’ (‘operator types’ we’d now call them)
who played fast and loose with the rules, but also ‘earth priests’ who
mediated local disputes, and ﬁnally prophets. The politicians were often
unconventional: for instance, it was not uncommon for the local ‘bull’
actually to be a woman whose parents had declared her a man for social
purposes; the priests were always outsiders to the region; but the prophet
was an altogether more extreme kind of ﬁgure. He might dribble, drool,
maintain a vacant stare, act like an epileptic; or engage in long but pointless
tasks such as spending hours arranging shells into designs on the ground in
the bush; or long periods in the wilderness; or he may even eat excrement
or ashes. Prophets, as Beidelman notes, ‘may speak in tongues, go into
trances, fast, balance on their head, wear feathers in their hair , be active by
night rather than by day , and may perch on rooftops. Some sit with tethering
pegs up their anuses.’33 Many , too, were physically deformed. Some were
cross-dressers, or given to unconventional sexual practices.
In other words, these were seriously unorthodox people. The impression
one gets from the literature is that any Nuer settlement of pre-colonial times
was likely to be complemented by a minor penumbra of what might be
termed extreme individuals; ones who in our own society would likely be
classiﬁed as anything from highly eccentric or deﬁantly queer to
neurodiver gent or mentally ill. Normally , prophets were treated with
bemused respect. They were ill; but the illness was a direct consequence of
being touched by God. As a result, when great calamities or unprecedented
events occurred – a plague, a foreign invasion – it was among this
penumbra that everyone looked for a charismatic leader appropriate to the
occasion. As a result, a person who might otherwise have spent his life as
something analogous to the village idiot would suddenly be found to have
remarkable powers of foresight and persuasion; even to be capable ofinspiring new social movements among the youth or co-ordinating elders
across Nuerland to put aside their dif ferences and mobilize around some
common goal; even, sometimes, to propose entirely dif ferent visions of
what Nuer society might be like.
WHA T CLAUDE LÉVI-STRAUSS LEARNED FROM THE
NAMBIKW ARA ABOUT THE ROLE OF CHIEFS, AND
SEASONAL V ARIA TIONS OF SOCIAL LIFE
Claude Lévi-Strauss is one of the few mid-twentieth-century
anthropologists to take seriously the idea that early humans were our
intellectual equals; hence his famous ar gument in The Savage Mind  that
mythological thought, rather than representing some sort of pre-logical
haze, is better conceived as a kind of ‘neolithic science’ as sophisticated as
our own, just built on dif ferent principles. Less well known – but more
relevant to the problems we are grappling with here – are some of his early
writings on politics.
In 1944, Lévi-Strauss published an essay about politics among the
Nambikwara, a small population of part-time farmers, part-time foragers
inhabiting a notoriously inhospitable stretch of savannah in northwest Mato
Grosso, Brazil. The Nambikwara then had a reputation as extremely simple
folk, given their very rudimentary material culture. For this reason, many
treated them almost as a direct window on to the Palaeolithic. This, Lévi-
Strauss pointed out, was a mistake. People like the Nambikwara live in the
shadow of the modern state, trading with farmers and city people and
sometimes hiring themselves out as labourers. Some might even be
descendants of runaways from cities or plantations. Still, he noted, their
ways of or ganizing their lives could be seen as a source of insights into
more general features of the human condition, especially as these pertain to
politics.
For Lévi-Strauss, what was especially instructive about the Nambikwara
was that, for all that they were averse to competition (they had little wealth
to compete over anyway), they did appoint chiefs to lead them. The very
simplicity of the resulting arrangement, he felt, might expose ‘some basic
functions’ of political life that ‘remain hidden in more complex and
elaborate systems of government’. Not only was the role of the chief
socially and psychologically quite similar to that of a national politician orstatesman in European society , he noted, it also attracted similar personality
types: people who ‘unlike most of their companions, enjoy prestige for its
own sake, feel a strong appeal to responsibility , and to whom the burden of
public af fairs brings its own reward’.34
Modern politicians play the role of wheelers and dealers, brokering
alliances or negotiating compromises between dif ferent constituencies or
interest groups. In Nambikwara society this didn’ t happen much because
there weren’ t really many dif ferences in wealth or status. However , chiefs
did play an analogous role, brokering between two entirely dif ferent social
and ethical systems, which obtained at dif ferent times of year . Allow us to
explain. In the 1940s, the Nambikwara lived in what were ef fectively two
very dif ferent societies. During the rainy season, they occupied hilltop
villages of several hundred people and practised horticulture; during the rest
of the year they dispersed into small foraging bands. Chiefs made or lost
their reputations by acting as heroic leaders during the ‘nomadic
adventures’ of the dry season, during which times they typically gave
orders, resolved crises and behaved in what would at any other time be
considered an unacceptably authoritarian manner; in the wet season, a time
of much greater ease and abundance, they relied on those reputations to
attract followers to settle around them in villages, where they employed
only gentle persuasion and led by example to guide their followers in the
construction of houses and tending of gardens. In doing so they cared for
the sick and needy , mediated disputes and never imposed anything on
anyone.
How should we think about these chiefs? They were not patriarchs, Lévi-
Strauss concluded; neither were they petty tyrants (even though for certain
limited periods they were allowed to act as such); and there was no sense in
which they were invested with mystical powers. More than anything, they
resembled modern politicians operating tiny embryonic welfare states,
pooling resources and doling them out to those in need. What impressed
Lévi-Strauss above all was their political maturity . It was the chiefs’ skill in
directing small bands of dry-season foragers, of making snap decisions in
crises (crossing a river , directing a hunt) that later qualiﬁed them to play the
role of mediators and diplomats in the village plaza. But in doing so they
were ef fectively moving back and forth, each year , between what
evolutionary anthropologists (in the tradition of T urgot) insist on thinkingof as totally dif ferent stages of social development: from hunters and
foragers to farmers and back again.
It was precisely this quality that made the Nambikwara chief such a
peculiarly familiar political ﬁgure: the calm sophistication with which he
shifted between what were in ef fect two dif ferent social systems, all the
while balancing a sense of personal ambition with the common good. These
chiefs were in every sense self-conscious political actors. And it was their
ﬂexibility and adaptability that enabled them to take such a distanced
perspective on whichever system obtained at any given time.
Although Lévi-Strauss went on to become the world’ s most renowned
anthropologist and perhaps the most famous intellectual in France, his early
essay on Nambikwara leadership fell into almost instant obscurity . To this
day, very few outside the ﬁeld of Amazonian studies have heard of it. One
reason is that in the post-war decades, Lévi-Strauss was moving in exactly
the opposite direction to the rest of his discipline. Where he emphasized
similarities between the lives of hunters, horticulturalists and modern
industrial democracies, almost everyone else – and particularly everyone
interested in foraging societies – was embracing new variations on T urgot,
though with updated language and backed up by a ﬂood of hard scientiﬁc
data. Throwing away old-fashioned distinctions between ‘savagery’,
‘barbarism’ and ‘civilization’, which were beginning to sound a little too
condescending, they settled on a new sequence, which ran from ‘bands’ to
‘tribes’ to ‘chiefdoms’ to ‘states’. The culmination of this trend was the
landmark Man the Hunter  symposium, held at the University of Chicago in
1966. This framed hunter -gatherer studies in terms of a new discipline
which its attendees proposed to call ‘behavioural ecology’, starting with
rigorously quantiﬁed studies of African savannah and rainforest groups –
the Kalahari San, Eastern Hadza and Mbuti Pygmies – including calorie
counts, time allocation studies and all sorts of data that simply hadn’ t been
available to earlier researchers.
The new studies overlapped with a sudden upswing of popular interest in
just these same African societies: for instance, the famous short ﬁlms about
the Kalahari Bushmen by the Marshalls (an American family of
anthropologists and ﬁlm-makers), which became ﬁxtures of introductory
anthropology courses and educational television across the world, along
with best-selling books like Colin T urnbull’ s The For est People . Before
long, it was simply assumed by almost everyone that foragers represented aseparate stage of social development, that they ‘live in small groups’, ‘move
around a lot’, reject any social distinctions other than those of age and
gender , and resolve conﬂicts by ‘ﬁssion’ rather than arbitration or
violence.35 The fact that these African societies were, in some cases at
least, refugee populations living in places no one else wanted, or that many
foraging societies documented in the ethnographic record (who had by this
time been lar gely wiped out by European settler colonialism and were thus
no longer available for quantitative analysis) were nothing like this, was
occasionally acknowledged. But it was rarely treated as particularly
relevant. The image of tiny egalitarian bands corresponded perfectly to
what those weaned on the legacy of Rousseau felt hunter -gatherers ought  to
have been like. Now there seemed to be hard, quantiﬁable scientiﬁc data
(and also movies!) to back it up.
In this new reality , Lévi-Strauss’ s Nambikwara were simply irrelevant.
After all, in evolutionary terms they weren’ t even really foragers, since they
only roamed about in foraging bands for seven or eight months a year . So
the apparent paradox that their lar ger village settlements were egalitarian
while their foraging bands were anything but could be ignored, lest it
tarnish this crisp new picture. The kind of political self-consciousness
which seemed so self-evident in Nambikwara chiefs, let alone the wild
improvisation expected of Nuer prophets, had no place in the revised
framework of human social evolution.
IN WHICH WE RETURN T O PREHIST ORY, AND CONSIDER
EVIDENCE FOR BOTH ‘EXTREME INDIVIDUALS’ AND
SEASONAL V ARIA TIONS OF SOCIAL LIFE IN THE ICE AGE
AND BEYOND
The twentieth-century Nambikwara, W innebago or Nuer cannot provide us
with direct windows on the past. What they can do is suggest angles of
investigation we might not otherwise have thought to look for . After
considering their social systems, it seems self-evident to ask if, in early
human societies, there is evidence for seasonal variations of social
structure; or if highly anomalous individuals were not only treated with
respect, but played important political roles in the Palaeolithic period. As it
turns out, the answer in both cases is ‘yes’. In fact, the evidence is
overwhelming.Let’s return to those rich Upper Palaeolithic burials, so often interpreted
as evidence for the emer gence of ‘inequality’, or even hereditary nobility of
some sort. For some odd reason, those who make such ar guments never
seem to notice – or , if they do, to attach much signiﬁcance to the fact – that
a quite remarkable number of these skeletons (indeed, a majority) bear
evidence of striking physical anomalies that could only have marked them
out, clearly and dramatically , from their social surroundings.36 The
adolescent boys in both Sunghir and Dolní Věstonice, for instance, had
pronounced congenital deformities; the bodies in the Romito Cave in
Calabria were unusually short, with at least one case of dwarﬁsm; while
those in Grimaldi Cave were extremely tall even by our standards, and must
have seemed veritable giants to their contemporaries.
All this seems very unlikely to be a coincidence. In fact, it makes one
wonder whether even those bodies, which appear from their skeletal
remains to be anatomically typical, might have been equally striking in
some other way; after all, an albino, for example, or an epileptic prophet
given to dividing his time between hanging upside down and arranging and
rearranging snail shells would not be identiﬁable as such from the
archaeological record. W e can’ t know much about the day-to-day lives of
Palaeolithic individuals buried with rich grave goods, other than that they
seem to have been as well fed and cared for as anybody else; but we can at
least suggest they were seen as the ultimate individuals, about as dif ferent
from their peers as it was possible to be.
What does all this really tell us about social inequality in the last Ice
Age? W ell, ﬁrst of all it suggests we might have to shelve any premature
talk of the emer gence of hereditary elites. It seems extremely unlikely that
Palaeolithic Europe produced a stratiﬁed elite that just happened to consist
largely of hunchbacks, giants and dwarfs. Second, we don’ t know how
much the treatment of such individuals after death had to do with their
treatment in life. Another important point here is that we are not dealing
with a case of some people being buried with rich grave goods and others
being buried with none. Rather it is a case of some people being buried with
rich grave goods, and most others not being buried at all.37 The very
practice of burying bodies intact, and clothed, appears to have been
exceptional in the Upper Palaeolithic. Most corpses were treated in
completely dif ferent ways: de-ﬂeshed, broken up, curated, or evenprocessed into jewellery and artefacts. (In general, Palaeolithic people were
clearly much more at home with human body parts than we are.)
The corpse in its complete and articulated form – and the clothed corpse
even more so – was clearly something unusual and, one would presume,
inherently strange. Some important circumstantial evidence reinforces this.
In many such cases, an ef fort was made to contain the bodies of the Upper
Palaeolithic dead by covering them with heavy objects: mammoth scapulae,
wooden planks, stones or tight bindings. Perhaps saturating them with
clothing, weapons and ornaments was an extension of these concerns,
celebrating but also containing something potentially dangerous. This too
makes sense. The ethnographic record abounds with examples of
anomalous beings – human or otherwise – treated as both exalted and
dangerous; or one way in life, another in death.
Much here is speculation. There are any number of other interpretations
that could be placed on the evidence – though the idea that these tombs
mark the emer gence of some sort of hereditary aristocracy seems the least
likely of all. Those interred were extraordinary , ‘extreme’ individuals. The
way they were treated – and here we are speaking not only about the
ostentatious display of riches, but that their corpses were decorated,
displayed and buried to begin with – marked them out as equally
extraordinary in death. Anomalous in almost every respect, such burials can
hardly be interpreted as proxies for social structure among the living. On
the other hand, they clearly have something to do with all the contemporary
evidence for music, sculpture, painting and complex architecture. What is
one to make of them?
This is where seasonality comes into the picture.
Almost all the Ice Age sites with extraordinary burials and monumental
architecture were created by societies that lived a little like Lévi-Strauss’ s
Nambikwara, dispersing into foraging bands at one time of year , gathering
together in concentrated settlements at another . True, they didn’ t gather to
plant crops. Rather , the lar ge Upper Palaeolithic sites are linked to
migrations and seasonal hunting of game herds – woolly mammoth, steppe
bison or reindeer – as well as cyclical ﬁsh-runs and nut harvests. This seems
to be the explanation for those hubs of activity found in eastern Europe at
places like Dolní Věstonice, where people took advantage of an abundance
of wild resources to feast, engage in complex rituals and ambitious artisticprojects, and trade minerals, marine shells and furs. In western Europe,
equivalents would be the great rock shelters of the French Périgord and the
Cantabrian coast, with their deep records of human activity , which similarly
formed part of an annual round of seasonal congregation and dispersal.38
Archaeology also shows that patterns of seasonal variation lie behind the
monuments of Göbekli T epe. Activities around the stone temples
correspond with periods of annual superabundance, between midsummer
and autumn, when lar ge herds of gazelle descended on to the Harran Plain.
At such times, people also gathered at the site to process massive quantities
of nuts and wild cereal grasses, making these into festive foods, which
presumably fuelled the work of construction.39 There is some evidence to
suggest that each of these great structures had a relatively short lifespan,
culminating in an enormous feast, after which its walls were rapidly ﬁlled in
with leftovers and other refuse: hierarchies raised to the sky , only to be
swiftly torn down again. Ongoing research is likely to complicate this
picture, but the overall pattern of seasonal congregation for festive labour
seems well established.
Such oscillating patterns of life endured long after the invention of
agriculture. T o take just one example, they may be key to understanding the
famous Neolithic monuments of Salisbury Plain in England, and not just
because the arrangements of standing stones themselves seem to function
(among other things) as giant calendars. Stonehenge, framing the
midsummer sunrise and the midwinter sunset, is the most famous of these.
It turns out to have been the last in a long sequence of ceremonial
structures, erected over the course of centuries in timber as well as stone, as
people conver ged on the plain from remote corners of the British Isles at
signiﬁcant times of year . Careful excavation shows that many of these
structures – now plausibly interpreted as monuments to the ancestors of a
Neolithic aristocracy – were dismantled just a few generations after their
construction.40
Still more striking, the people who built Stonehenge were not farmers, or
not in the usual sense. They had once been; but the practice of erecting and
dismantling grand monuments coincides with a period when the peoples of
Britain, having adopted the Neolithic farming economy from continental
Europe, appear to have turned their backs on at least one crucial aspect of it:
abandoning the cultivation of cereals and returning, from around 3300 BC,
to the collection of hazelnuts as their staple source of plant food. On theother hand, they kept hold of their domestic pigs and herds of cattle,
feasting on them seasonally at nearby Durrington W alls, a prosperous town
of some thousands of people – with its own W oodhenge – in winter , but
largely empty and abandoned in summer . The builders of Stonehenge seem
to have been neither foragers nor herders, but something in between.41
All this is crucial because it’ s hard to imagine how giving up agriculture
could have been anything but a self-conscious decision. There is no
evidence that one population displaced another , or that farmers were
somehow overwhelmed by powerful foragers who forced them to abandon
their crops. The Neolithic inhabitants of England appear to have taken the
measure of cereal-farming and collectively decided that they preferred to
live another way . How could such a decision have been made? W e’ll never
know , but Stonehenge itself provides something of a hint since it is built of
extremely lar ge stones, some of which (the ‘bluestones’) were transported
from as far away as W ales, while many of the cattle and pigs consumed at
Durrington W alls were laboriously herded there from other distant
locations.42
In other words, and remarkable as it may seem, even in the third
millennium BC co-ordination of some sort was clearly possible across lar ge
parts of the British Isles. If Stonehenge was a shrine to exalted founders of a
ruling clan – as some archaeologists now ar gue – it seems likely that
members of their lineage claimed signiﬁcant, even cosmic roles by virtue of
their involvement in such events. On the other hand, patterns of seasonal
aggregation and dispersal raise another question: if there were kings and
queens at Stonehenge, exactly what sort could they have been? After all,
these would have been kings whose courts and kingdoms existed for only a
few months of the year , and otherwise dispersed into small communities of
nut gatherers and stock herders. If they possessed the means to marshal
labour , pile up food resources and provender armies of year -round retainers,
what sort of royalty would consciously elect not to do so?
CONCERNING ‘BUFF ALO POLICE’ (IN WHICH WE
REDISCOVER THE ROLE OF SEASONALITY IN HUMAN
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE)
Recall that for Lévi-Strauss, there was a clear link between seasonal
variations of social structure and a certain kind of political freedom. Thefact that one structure applied in the rainy season and another in the dry
allowed Nambikwara chiefs to view their own social arrangements at one
remove: to see them as not simply ‘given’, in the natural order of things, but
as something at least partially open to human intervention. The case of the
British Neolithic – with its alternating phases of dispersal and monumental
construction – indicates just how far such intervention could sometimes go.
Writing in the midst of the Second W orld W ar, Lévi-Strauss probably
didn’ t think he was saying anything all that extraordinary . For
anthropologists in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century , it was common
knowledge that societies doing a great deal of hunting, herding or foraging
were often arranged in such a ‘double morphology’ (as Lévi-Strauss’ s great
predecessor Marcel Mauss put it).43 Lévi-Strauss was simply highlighting
some of the political implications. But these implications are important.
What the existence of similar seasonal patterns in the Palaeolithic suggests
is that from the very beginning, or at least as far back as we can trace such
things, human beings were self-consciously experimenting with dif ferent
social possibilities. It might be useful here to look back at this for gotten
anthropological literature, with which Lévi-Strauss would have been
intimately familiar , to get a sense of just how dramatic these seasonal
differences might be.
The key text here is Marcel Mauss and Henri Beuchat’ s (1903) ‘Seasonal
Variations of the Eskimo’. The authors begin by observing that the
circumpolar Inuit ‘and likewise many other societies … have two social
structures, one in summer and one in winter , and that in parallel they have
two systems of law and religion’. In the summer , Inuit dispersed into bands
of roughly twenty or thirty people to pursue freshwater ﬁsh, caribou and
reindeer , all under the authority of a single male elder . During this period,
property was possessively marked and patriarchs exercised coercive,
sometimes even tyrannical power over their kin – much more so than the
Nambikwara chiefs in the dry season. But in the long winter months, when
seals and walrus ﬂocked to the Arctic shore, there was a dramatic reversal.
Then, Inuit gathered together to build great meeting houses of wood, whale
rib and stone; within these houses, virtues of equality , altruism and
collective life prevailed. W ealth was shared, and husbands and wives
exchanged partners under the aegis of Sedna, the Goddess of the Sea.44
Mauss thought the Inuit were an ideal case study because, living in the
Arctic, they were facing some of the most extreme environmentalconstraints it was possible to endure. Y et even in sub-Arctic conditions,
Mauss calculated, physical considerations – availability of game, building
materials and the like – explained at best 40 per cent of the picture. (Other
circumpolar peoples, he noted, including close neighbours of the Inuit
facing near -identical physical conditions, or ganized themselves quite
differently .) To a lar ge extent, he concluded, Inuit lived the way they did
because they felt that’ s how humans ought to live.
Around the same time that Marcel Mauss was combing French libraries
for everything that had ever been written about the Inuit, the German
ethnologist Franz Boas was carrying out research on the Kwakiutl,
indigenous hunter -gatherers of Canada’ s Northwest Coast. Here, Boas
discovered, it was winter – not summer – that was the time when society
crystallized into its most hierarchical forms, and spectacularly so. Plank-
built palaces sprang to life along the coastline of British Columbia, with
hereditary nobles holding court over compatriots classiﬁed as commoners
and slaves, and hosting the great banquets known as potlatch . Yet these
aristocratic courts broke apart for the summer work of the ﬁshing season,
reverting to smaller clan formations – still ranked, but with entirely
different and much less formal structures. In this case, people actually
adopted dif ferent names in summer and winter – literally becoming
someone else, depending on the time of year .45
Emigrating to the US, Boas went on to become a professor at New Y ork’s
Columbia University , where he ended up training virtually everyone who
was to make a name for themselves in American anthropology for the next
half-century . One of his students, a V iennese-born ethnographer named
Robert Lowie (who was also a close friend of Paul Radin, author of
Primitive Man as Philosopher ) did ﬁeldwork among the Mandan-Hidatsa
and Crow people of what are now Montana and W yoming, and spent much
of his career thinking through the political implications of seasonal
variation among nineteenth-century tribal confederacies on the Great Plains.
Plains nations were one-time farmers who had lar gely abandoned cereal
agriculture, after re-domesticating escaped Spanish horses and adopting a
largely nomadic mode of life. In late summer and early autumn, small and
highly mobile bands of Cheyenne and Lakota would congregate in lar ge
settlements to make logistical preparations for the buf falo hunt. At this most
sensitive time of year they appointed a police force that exercised full
coercive powers, including the right to imprison, whip or ﬁne any of fenderwho endangered the proceedings. Y et, as Lowie observed, this ‘unequivocal
authoritarianism’ operated on a strictly seasonal and temporary basis. Once
the hunting season – and the collective Sun Dance rituals that followed –
were complete, such authoritarianism gave way to what he called ‘anarchic’
forms of or ganization, society splitting once again into small, mobile bands.
Lowie’ s observations are startling:
In order to ensure a maximum kill, a police force – either coinciding
with a military club, or appointed ad hoc , or serving by virtue of
clan afﬁliation – issued orders and restrained the disobedient. In
most of the tribes they not only conﬁscated game clandestinely
procured, but whipped the of fender , destroyed his property , and, in
case of resistance, killed him. The very same or ganisation which in
a murder case would merely use moral suasion turned into an
inexorable State agency during a buf falo drive. However …
coercive measures extended considerably beyond the hunt: the
soldiers also forcibly restrained braves intent on starting war parties
that were deemed inopportune by the chief; directed mass
migrations; supervised the crowds at a major festival; and might
otherwise maintain law and order .46
‘During a lar ge part of the year ,’ Lowie continued, ‘the tribe simply did not
exist as such; and the families or minor unions of familiars that jointly
sought a living required no special disciplinary or ganization. The soldiers
were thus a concomitant of numerically strong aggregations, hence
functioned intermittently rather than continuously .’ But the soldiers’
sovereignty , he stressed, was no less real for its temporary nature. As a
result, Lowie insisted that Plains Indians did in fact know something of
state power , even though they never actually developed a state.
It’s easy to see why the neo-evolutionists of the 1950s and 1960s might
not have known quite what to do with this legacy of ﬁeldwork observations.
They were ar guing for the existence of discrete stages of political
organization – successively: bands, tribes, chiefdoms, states – and held that
the stages of political development mapped, at least very roughly , on to
similar stages of economic development: hunter -gatherers, gardeners,
farmers, industrial civilization. It was confusing enough that people like the
Nambikwara seemed to jump back and forth, over the course of the year ,between economic categories. The Cheyenne, Crow , Assiniboine or Lakota
would appear to jump regularly from one end of the political spectrum to
the other . They were a kind of band/state amalgam. In other words, they
threw everything askew .
Still, Lowie is absolutely unequivocal on this point, and he was by no
means the only anthropologist to observe it.47 Most interestingly for our
own perspective, he too stressed that the Plains Indians were conscious
political actors, keenly aware of the possibilities and dangers of
authoritarian power . Not only did they dismantle all means of exercising
coercive authority the moment the ritual season was over , they were also
careful to rotate which clan or warrior clubs got to wield it: anyone holding
sovereignty one year would be subject to the authority of others in the
next.48
Scholarship does not always advance. Sometimes it slips backwards. A
hundred years ago, most social scientists understood that those who live
mainly from wild resources were not normally restricted to tiny ‘bands’. As
we’ve seen, the assumption that they were only gained ground in the 1960s.
In this regard, our earlier invocation of biker gangs and hippie communes
wasn’ t entirely whimsical. These were the images being bounced around in
the popular imagination at that time, and invoked in debates about human
nature. It’ s surely no coincidence that the most popular ethnographic ﬁlms
of the post-war era either focused on the Kalahari Bushmen and Mbuti
Pygmies (‘band’ societies, which could be imagined as roughly resembling
hippie communes); or on the Y anomami or ‘ﬁerce people’ (Amazonian
horticulturalists who, in Napoleon Chagnon’ s version of reality – but not,
let’s recall, in Helena V alero’ s – do bear a rather disturbing resemblance to
Hell’ s Angels).
Since in this new , evolutionist narrative ‘states’ were deﬁned above all by
their monopoly on the ‘legitimate use of coercive force’, the nineteenth-
century Cheyenne or Lakota would have been seen as evolving from the
‘band’ level to the ‘state’ level roughly every November , and then
devolving back again come spring. Obviously , this is silly. No one would
seriously suggest such a thing. Still, it’ s worth pointing out because it
exposes the much deeper silliness of the initial assumption: that societies
must necessarily progress through a series of evolutionary stages to begin
with. Y ou can’ t speak of an evolution from band to tribe to chiefdom tostate if your starting points are groups that move ﬂuidly between them as a
matter of habit.
Seasonal dualism also throws into chaos more recent ef forts at classifying
hunter -gatherers into either ‘simple’ or ‘complex’ types, since what have
been identiﬁed as the diagnostic features of ‘complexity’ – territoriality ,
social ranks, material wealth or competitive display – appear during certain
seasons of the year , only to be brushed aside in others by the exact same
population. Admittedly , most professional anthropologists nowadays have
come to recognize that these categories are hopelessly inadequate, but the
main ef fect of this acknowledgement has just been to cause them to change
the subject, or suggest that perhaps we shouldn’ t really be thinking about
the broad sweep of human history at all any more. Nobody has yet proposed
an alternative.
Meanwhile, as we’ve seen, archaeological evidence is piling up to
suggest that in the highly seasonal environments of the last Ice Age, our
remote ancestors were behaving much like the Inuit, Nambikwara or Crow .
They shifted back and forth between alternative social arrangements,
building monuments and then closing them down again, allowing the rise of
authoritarian structures during certain times of year then dismantling them –
all, it would seem, on the understanding that no particular social order was
ever ﬁxed or immutable. The same individual could experience life in what
looks to us sometimes like a band, sometimes a tribe, and sometimes like
something with at least some of the characteristics we now identify with
states.
With such institutional ﬂexibility comes the capacity to step outside the
boundaries of any given structure and reﬂect; to both make and unmake the
political worlds we live in. If nothing else, this explains the ‘princes’ and
‘princesses’ of the last Ice Age, who appear to show up, in such magniﬁcent
isolation, like characters in some kind of fairy tale or costume drama.
Maybe they were almost literally so. If they reigned at all, then perhaps it
was, like the ruling clans of Stonehenge, just for a season.49
WHY THE REAL QUESTION IS NOT ‘WHA T ARE THE ORIGINS
OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY?’ BUT ‘HOW DID WE GET STUCK?’
If we are right, and if human beings really have spent most of the last
40,000 or so years moving back and forth between dif ferent forms of socialorganization, building up hierarchies then dismantling them again, the
implications are profound. For one thing, it suggests that Pierre Clastres
was quite right when he proposed that, rather than being less politically
self-conscious than people nowadays, people in stateless societies might
actually have been considerably more so.
Clastres was another product of the 1960s. A student of Lévi-Strauss, he
took to heart his master ’s view of Amazonian chiefs as mature political
actors. But Clastres was also an anarchist (he was ultimately kicked out of
Lévi-Strauss’ s research group on a ﬂimsy pretext, involving unauthorized
use of ofﬁcial stationery), and he took the ar gument much further . It wasn’ t
just that Amazonian chiefs were calculating politicians. They were
calculating politicians forced to manoeuvre in a social environment
apparently designed to ensure they could never exercise real political
power . In the winter , the groups they led were tiny and inconsequential. In
the summer , they didn’ t ‘lead’ at all. Y es, their houses might have
resembled social service dispensaries in modern welfare states; but as a
result, in terms of material wealth, they were actually the poorest men in the
village, since chiefs were expected constantly to give everything away .
They were also expected to set an example by working much harder than
everybody else. Even where they did have special privileges, like the T upi
or Nambikwara chiefs, who were the only men in their villages allowed to
have multiple wives, the privilege was distinctly double-edged. The wives
were held to be necessary to prepare feasts for the village. If any of those
wives looked to other lovers, which it appears they ordinarily did, there was
nothing much the chief could do about it, since he had to keep himself in
everyone’ s good graces to remain chief.
Chiefs found themselves in this situation, Clastres ar gued, because they
weren’ t the only ones who were mature and insightful political actors;
almost everyone was. Rather than being trapped in some sort of
Rousseauian innocence, unable to imagine more complex forms of
organization, people were generally more capable than we are of imagining
alternative social orders, and therefore had created ‘societies against the
state’. They had self-consciously or ganized in such a way that the forms of
arbitrary power and domination we associate with ‘advanced political
systems’ could never possibly emer ge.
Clastres’ s argument was, as one might imagine, highly controversial.
Some of the criticism directed at him was entirely justiﬁed (he had, forexample, an enormous blind spot when it came to gender). Still, most of it
was based on ﬁrm Rousseauian ground, insisting Clastres was ascribing too
much imagination to ‘primitive’ or ‘archaic’ people who, almost by
deﬁnition, shouldn’ t have any . How could one possibly claim, so such
criticism went, that stateless societies were self-consciously or ganizing
themselves to prevent the emer gence of something they’d never actually
experienced?
There are a lot of possible ways in which to respond to this objection.
Were Amazonians of centuries past, for instance, entirely unaware of the
great Andean empires to their west? People used to get around. It’ s unlikely
they simply had no idea of developments in neighbouring parts of the
continent. As we’ll see in Chapter Seven , there is also now a good deal of
evidence for the existence of lar ge polities in Amazonia itself, in much
earlier times. Perhaps these were the children of rebels who ﬂed or even
overthrew such ancient kingdoms. But the most obvious objection is that, if
the Amazonians in question were anything like the Nambikwara, they
actually did experience relations of arbitrary command during their yearly
‘adventures’ as foraging bands. Y et, oddly , Clastres himself never pointed
this out. In fact, he never really talks about seasonality at all.
This is a curious omission. It’ s also an important one because, by leaving
it out, Clastres really put the ﬁnal nail in the cofﬁn of that earlier tradition
running from Marcel Mauss through to Robert Lowie; a tradition which
treated ‘primitive’ societies as inherently ﬂexible, and typically
characterized by multiple forms of or ganization. Now , both the neo-
evolutionists who saw ‘primitive’ folk as Rousseauian naïfs  and the radicals
who insisted they were self-conscious egalitarians equally took it for
granted they were stuck in a single, very simple mode of social existence.
In Clastres’ s case it’ s all the more surprising, because in his original
statement on the powerlessness of Indian chiefs, published in 1962, he is
quite candid in admitting he pinched almost his entire ar gument from
Lowie. Fourteen years earlier , Lowie had ar gued that most indigenous
American societies, from Montreal to T ierra del Fuego, were ef fectively
anarchists.50 His ar gument that the ‘typical Indian chief is not a lawgiver ,
executive, or judge, but a paciﬁer , a benefactor of the poor , and a prolix
Polonius’ (that is, the actual functions of chieﬂy ofﬁce are to (1) mediate
quarrels, (2) provide for the needy , and (3) to entertain with beautiful
speeches) is precisely echoed, point by point, in Clastres’ s account. So isLowie’ s conclusion that, since the chieﬂy ofﬁce is ef fectively designed so it
can never be turned into a means of compulsion, the only way state-like
authority could possibly have emer ged was from religious visionaries of
one sort or another .
Recall, though, that Lowie’ s original piece included one additional
section, on the ‘evolutionary germs’ of top-down authority , which describes
the seasonal ‘police’ and ‘soldiers’ of the Plains societies in detail. Clastres
simply left it out. Why?
The answer is probably a simple one: seasonality was confusing. In fact,
it’s kind of a wild card. The societies of the Great Plains created structures
of coercive authority that lasted throughout the entire season of hunting and
the rituals that followed, dissolving when they dispersed into smaller
groups. But those of central Brazil dispersed into foraging bands as a way
of asserting a political authority that was inef fectual in village settings.
Among the Inuit, fathers ruled in the summertime; but in winter gatherings
patriarchal authority and even norms of sexual propriety were challenged,
subverted or simply melted away . The Kwakiutl were hierarchical at both
times of year , but nonetheless maintained dif ferent forms of hierarchy ,
giving ef fective police powers to performers in the Midwinter Ceremonial
(the ‘bear dancers’ and ‘fool dancers’) that could be exercised only during
the actual performance of the ritual. At other times, aristocrats commanded
great wealth but couldn’ t give their followers direct orders. Many Central
African forager societies are egalitarian all year round, but appear to
alternate monthly between a ritual order dominated by men and another
dominated by women.51
In other words, there is no single pattern. The only consistent
phenomenon is the very fact of alteration, and the consequent awareness of
different social possibilities. What all this conﬁrms is that searching for ‘the
origins of social inequality’ really is asking the wrong question.
If human beings, through most of our history , have moved back and forth
ﬂuidly between dif ferent social arrangements, assembling and dismantling
hierarchies on a regular basis, maybe the real question should be ‘how did
we get stuck?’ How did we end up in one single mode? How did we lose
that political self-consciousness, once so typical of our species? How did
we come to treat eminence and subservience not as temporary expedients,
or even the pomp and circumstance of some kind of grand seasonal theatre,but as inescapable elements of the human condition? If we started out just
playing games, at what point did we for get that we were playing?
We’ll be tackling such questions in the chapters to come. For the moment,
the main thing to stress is that this ﬂexibility , and potential for political self-
consciousness, was never entirely lost. Mauss pointed out much the same
thing. Seasonality is still with us – even if it is a pale, contracted shadow of
its former self. In the Christian world, for instance, there is still the
midwinter ‘holiday season’ in which values and forms of or ganization do,
to a limited degree, reverse themselves: the same media and advertisers
who for most of the year peddle rabid consumerist individualism suddenly
start announcing that social relations are what’ s really important, and that to
give is better than to receive. (And in enlightened countries like Mauss’ s
France, there’ s also the summer grandes vacances  in which everybody
downs tools for a month and ﬂees the cities.)
There is a direct historical connection here. W e’ve already seen how ,
among societies like the Inuit or Kwakiutl, times of seasonal congregation
were also ritual seasons, almost entirely given over to dances, rites and
dramas. Sometimes these could involve creating temporary kings or even
ritual police with real coercive powers (though often, peculiarly , these ritual
police doubled as clowns).52 In other cases, they involved dissolving
norms of hierarchy and propriety , as in the Inuit midwinter or gies. This
dichotomy can still be observed in festive life almost everywhere. In the
European Middle Ages, to take a familiar example, saints’ days alternated
between solemn pageants where all the elaborate ranks and hierarchies of
feudal life were made manifest (much as they still are in, say , a college
graduation ceremony , when we temporarily revert to medieval garb), and
crazy carnivals in which everyone played at ‘turning the world upside
down’. In carnival, women might rule over men, children be put in char ge
of government, servants could demand work from their masters, ancestors
could return from the dead, ‘carnival kings’ could be crowned and then
dethroned, giant monuments like wicker dragons built and set on ﬁre, or all
formal ranks might even disintegrate into one or other form of Bacchanalian
chaos.53
Just as with seasonality , there’ s no consistent pattern. Ritual occasions
can either be much more stif f and formal, or much more wild and playful,
than ordinary life. Alternatively , like funerals and wakes, they can slip backand forth between the two. The same seems to be true of festive life almost
everywhere, whether it’ s Peru, Benin or China. This is why anthropologists
often have such trouble deﬁning what a ‘ritual’ even is. If you start from the
solemn ones, ritual is a matter of etiquette, propriety: High Church ritual,
for example, is really just a very elaborate version of table manners. Some
have gone so far as to ar gue that what we call ‘social structure’ only really
exists during rituals: think here of families that only exist as a physical
group during marriages and funerals, during which times questions of rank
and priority have to be worked out by who sits at which table, who speaks
ﬁrst, who gets the topmost cut of the hump of a sacriﬁced water buf falo, or
the ﬁrst slice of wedding cake.
But sometimes festivals are moments where entirely dif ferent social
structures take over , such as the ‘youth abbeys’ that seem to have existed
across medieval Europe, with their Boy Bishops, May Queens, Lords of
Misrule, Abbots of Unreason and Princes of Sots, who during the
Christmas, Mayday or carnival season temporarily took over many of the
functions of government and enacted a bawdy parody of government’ s
everyday forms. So there’ s another school of thought which says that rituals
are really exactly the opposite. The really powerful ritual moments are
those of collective chaos, ef fervescence, liminality or creative play , out of
which new social forms can come into the world.54
There is also a centuries-long, and frankly not very enlightening, debate
over whether the most apparently subversive popular festivals were really
as subversive as they seem; or if they are really conservative, allowing
common folk a chance to blow of f a little steam and give vent to their baser
instincts before returning to everyday habits of obedience.55 It strikes us
that all this rather misses the point.
What’ s really important about such festivals is that they kept the old
spark of political self-consciousness alive. They allowed people to imagine
that other arrangements are feasible, even for society as a whole, since it
was always possible to fantasize about carnival bursting its seams and
becoming the new reality . In the popular Babylonian story of Semiramis,
the eponymous servant girl convinces the Assyrian king to let her be
‘Queen for a Day’ during some annual festival, promptly has him arrested,
declares herself empress and leads her new armies to conquer the world.
May Day came to be chosen as the date for the international workers’
holiday lar gely because so many British peasant revolts had historicallybegun on that riotous festival. V illagers who played at ‘turning the world
upside’ would periodically decide they actually preferred the world upside
down, and took measures to keep it that way .
Medieval peasants often found it much easier than medieval intellectuals
to imagine a society of equals. Now , perhaps, we begin to understand why .
Seasonal festivals may be a pale echo of older patterns of seasonal variation
– but, for the last few thousand years of human history at least, they appear
to have played much the same role in fostering political self-consciousness,
and as laboratories of social possibility . The ﬁrst kings may well have been
play kings. Then they became real kings. Now most (but not all) existing
kings have been reduced once again to play kings – as least insofar as they
mainly perform ceremonial functions and no longer wield real power . But
even if all monarchies, including ceremonial monarchies, were to disappear ,
some people would still play at being kings.
Even in the European Middle Ages, in places where monarchy was
unquestioned as a mode of government, ‘Abbots of Unreason’, Y uletide
Kings and the like tended to be chosen either by election or by sortition
(lottery), the very forms of collective decision-making that resurfaced,
apparently out of nowhere, in the Enlightenment. (What’ s more, such
ﬁgures tended to exercise power much in the manner of indigenous
American chiefs: either limited to very circumscribed contexts, like the war
chiefs who could give orders only during military expeditions; or like
village chiefs who were arrayed with formal honours but couldn’ t tell
anybody what to do.) For a great many societies, the festive year could be
read as a veritable encyclopaedia of possible political forms.
WHA T BEING SAPIENS REALL Y MEANS
Let us end this chapter where we began it. For far too long we have been
generating myths. As a result, we’ve been mostly asking the wrong
questions: are festive rituals expressions of authority , or vehicles for social
creativity? Are they reactionary or progressive? W ere our earliest ancestors
simple and egalitarian, or complex and stratiﬁed? Is human nature innocent
or corrupt? Are we, as a species, inherently co-operative or competitive,
kind or selﬁsh, good or evil?
Perhaps all these questions blind us to what really makes us human in the
ﬁrst place, which is our capacity – as moral and social beings – to negotiatebetween such alternatives. As we’ve already observed, it makes no sense to
ask any such questions of a ﬁsh or a hedgehog. Animals already exist in a
state ‘beyond good and evil’, the very one that Nietzsche dreamed humans
might also aspire to. Perhaps we are doomed always to be ar guing about
such things. But certainly , it is more interesting to start asking other
questions as well. If nothing else, surely the time has come to stop the
swinging pendulum that has ﬁxated generations of philosophers, historians
and social scientists, leading their gaze from Hobbes to Rousseau, from
Rousseau to Hobbes and back again. W e do not have to choose any more
between an egalitarian or hierarchical start to the human story . Let us bid
farewell to the ‘childhood of Man’ and acknowledge (as Lévi-Strauss
insisted) that our early ancestors were not just our cognitive equals, but our
intellectual peers too. Likely as not, they grappled with the paradoxes of
social order and creativity just as much as we do; and understood them – at
least the most reﬂexive among them – just as much, which also means just
as little. They were perhaps more aware of some things and less aware of
others. They were neither ignorant savages nor wise sons and daughters of
nature. They were, as Helena V alero said of the Y anomami, just people, like
us; equally perceptive, equally confused.
Be this as it may , it’s becoming increasing clear that the earliest known
evidence of human social life resembles a carnival parade of political
forms, far more than it does the drab abstractions of evolutionary theory . If
there is a riddle here it’ s this: why , after millennia of constructing and
disassembling forms of hierarchy , did Homo sapiens  – supposedly the
wisest of apes – allow permanent and intractable systems of inequality to
take root? W as this really a consequence of adopting agriculture? Of
settling down in permanent villages and, later , towns? Should we be
looking for a moment in time like the one Rousseau envisaged, when
somebody ﬁrst enclosed a tract of land, declaring: ‘This is mine and always
will be!’ Or is that another fool’ s errand?
These are the questions to which we now turn.4
Free People, the Origin of Cultures, and the Advent of
Private Property
(Not necessarily in that or der)
Changing your social identity with the changing seasons might sound like a
wonderful idea, but it’ s not something anyone reading this book is ever
likely to experience ﬁrst-hand. Y et until very recently , the European
continent was still littered with folk practices that echoed these ancient
rhythmic oscillations of social structure. Folklorists have long puzzled over
all the little brigades of people disguised as plants and animals, the Straw
Bears and Green Men, who marched dutifully out each spring and autumn
into village squares, everywhere from rural England to the Rhodope
Mountains of southern Bulgaria: were they genuine traces of ancient
practices, or recent revivals and reinventions? Or revivals of traces? Or
traces of revivals? It’ s often impossible to tell.
Most of these rituals have been gradually brushed aside as pagan
superstition or repackaged as tourist attractions (or both). For the most part,
all we’re left with as an alternative to our mundane lives are our ‘national
holidays’: frantic periods of over -consumption, crammed in the gaps
between work, in which we entertain solemn injunctions that consumption
isn’t really what matters about life. As we’ve seen, our remote forager
ancestors were much bolder experimenters in social form, breaking apart
and reassembling their societies at dif ferent scales, often in radically
different forms, with dif ferent value systems, from one time of year to the
next. The festive calendars of the great agrarian civilizations of Eurasia,
Africa and the Americas turn out to be mere distant echoes of that world
and the political freedoms it entailed.
Still, we could never have ﬁgured that out by material evidence alone. If
all we had to go on were Palaeolithic ‘mammoth buildings’ on the Russiansteppe, or the princely burials of the Ligurian Ice Age and their associated
physical remains, scholars would no doubt be left scratching their heads
until the sun explodes. Human beings may be (indeed, we’ve ar gued they
are) fundamentally imaginative creatures, but no one is that imaginative.
You would have to be either extremely naive or extremely arrogant to think
anybody could simply logic such matters out. (And even if someone did
manage to come up with anything like Nuer prophets, Kwakiutl clown-
police or Inuit seasonal wife-swapping or gies, simply through logical
extrapolation they’d probably be instantly written of f as kooks.)
This is precisely why the ethnographic record is so important. The Nuer
and Inuit should never have been seen as ‘windows on to our ancestral
past’. They are creations of the modern age just the same as we are – but
they do show us possibilities we never would have thought of and prove
that people are actually capable of enacting such possibilities, even building
whole social systems and value systems around them. In short, they remind
us that human beings are far more interesting than (other) human beings are
sometimes inclined to imagine.
In this chapter , we’ll do two things. First, we’ll continue our story
forwards in time from the Palaeolithic, looking at some of the extraordinary
cultural arrangements that emer ged across the world before our ancestors
turned their hands to farming. Second, we’ll start answering the question we
posed in the last chapter: how did we get stuck? How did some human
societies begin to move away from the ﬂexible, shifting arrangements that
appear to have characterized our earliest ancestors, in such a way that
certain individuals or groups were able to claim permanent power over
others: men over women; elders over youth; and eventually , priestly castes,
warrior aristocracies and rulers who actually ruled?
IN WHICH WE DESCRIBE HOW THE OVERALL COURSE OF
HUMAN HIST ORY HAS MEANT THA T MOST PEOPLE LIVE
THEIR LIVES ON AN EVER-SMALLER SCALE AS
POPULA TIONS GET LARGER
In order for these things to become possible, a number of other factors ﬁrst
had to fall into place. One is the very existence of what we would
intuitively recognize as discrete ‘societies’ to begin with. It may not even
make sense to describe the mammoth hunters of Upper Palaeolithic Europeas being or ganized into separate, bounded societies, in the way we talk
about the nations of Europe, or for that matter First Nations of Canada like
the Mohawk, W endat or Montagnais-Naskapi.
Of course, we know almost nothing about the languages people were
speaking in the Upper Palaeolithic, their myths, initiation rituals, or
conceptions of the soul; but we do know that, from the Swiss Alps to Outer
Mongolia, they were often using remarkably similar tools,1 playing
remarkably similar musical instruments, carving similar female ﬁgurines,
wearing similar ornaments and conducting similar funeral rites. What’ s
more, there is reason to believe that at certain points in their lives,
individual men and women often travelled very long distances.2
Surprisingly , current studies of hunter -gatherers suggest that this is almost
exactly what one should expect.
Research among groups such as the East African Hadza or Australian
Martu shows that while forager societies today may be numerically small,
their composition is remarkably cosmopolitan. When forager bands gather
into lar ger residential groups these are not, in any sense, made up of a tight-
knit unit of closely related kin; in fact, primarily biological relations
constitute on average a mere 10 per cent of total membership. Most
members are drawn from a much wider pool of individuals, many from
quite far away , who may not even speak the same ﬁrst languages.3 This is
true even for contemporary groups that are ef fectively encapsulated in
restricted territories, surrounded by farmers and pastoralists.
In earlier centuries, forms of regional or ganization might extend
thousands of miles. Aboriginal Australians, for instance, could travel
halfway across the continent, moving among people who spoke entirely
different languages, and still ﬁnd camps divided into the same kinds of
totemic moieties that existed at home. What this means is that half the
residents owed them hospitality , but had to be treated as ‘brothers’ and
‘sisters’ (so sexual relations were strictly prohibited); while another half
were both potential enemies and marriage partners. Similarly , a North
American 500 years ago could travel from the shores of the Great Lakes to
the Louisiana bayous and still ﬁnd settlements – speaking languages
entirely unrelated to their own – with members of their own Bear , Elk or
Beaver clans who were obliged to host and feed them.4
It’s difﬁcult enough to reconstruct how these forms of long-distance
organization operated just a few centuries ago, before they were destroyedby the coming of European settlers. So we can really only guess how
analogous systems might have worked some 40,000 years ago. But the
striking material uniformities observed by archaeologists across very long
distances attest to the existence of such systems. ‘Society’, insofar as we
can comprehend it at that time, spanned continents.
Much of this seems counter -intuitive. W e are used to assuming that
advances in technology are continually making the world a smaller place. In
a purely physical sense, of course, this is true: the domestication of the
horse, and gradual improvements in seafaring, to take just two examples,
certainly made it much easier for people to move around. But at the same
time, increases in the sheer number of human beings seem to have pulled in
the opposite direction, ensuring that, for much of human history , ever -
diminishing proportions of people actually travelled – at least, over long
distances or very far from home. If we survey what happens over time, the
scale on which social relations operate doesn’ t get bigger and bigger; it
actually gets smaller and smaller .
A cosmopolitan Upper Palaeolithic is followed by a complicated period
of several thousand years, beginning around 12,000 BC, in which it ﬁrst
becomes possible to trace the outlines of separate ‘cultures’ based on more
than just stone tools. Some foragers, after this time, continued following
large mammal herds; others settled on the coast and became ﬁsherfolk, or
gathered acorns in forests. Prehistorians use the term ‘Mesolithic’ for these
postglacial populations. Across lar ge parts of Africa and East Asia, their
technological innovations – including pottery , ‘micro-lithic’ tool kits and
stone grinding tools – signal new ways of preparing and eating wild grains,
roots and other vegetables: chopping, slicing, grating, grinding, soaking,
draining, boiling, and also ways of storing, smoking and otherwise
preserving meats, plant foods and ﬁsh.5
Before long these had spread everywhere, and paved the way for the
creation of what we’d now call cuisine: the kind of soups, porridges, stews,
broths and fermented beverages we’re familiar with today . But cuisines are
also, almost everywhere, markers of dif ference. People who wake up to ﬁsh
stews every morning tend to see themselves as a dif ferent sort of people
from those who breakfast on a porridge of berries and wild oats. Such
distinctions were no doubt echoed by parallel developments that are much
more difﬁcult to reconstruct: dif ferent tastes in clothing, dancing, drugs,
hairstyles, courtship rituals; dif ferent forms of kinship or ganization andstyles of formal rhetoric. The ‘culture areas’ of these Mesolithic foragers
were still extremely lar ge. T rue, the Neolithic versions that soon developed
alongside them – associated with the ﬁrst farming populations – were
typically smaller; but for the most part they still spread out over territories
considerably lar ger than most modern nation states.
Only much later do we begin to encounter the kind of situation familiar
to anthropologists of Amazonia or Papua New Guinea, where a single river
valley might contain speakers of half a dozen dif ferent languages, with
entirely distinct economic systems or cosmological beliefs. Sometimes, of
course, this tendency towards micro-dif ferentiation was reversed – as with
the spread of imperial languages like English or Han Chinese. But the
overall direction of history – at least until very recently – would seem to be
the very opposite of globalization. It is one of increasingly local
allegiances: extraordinary cultural inventiveness, but much of it aimed at
ﬁnding new ways for people to set themselves of f against each other . True,
the lar ger regional networks of hospitality endured in some places.6
Overall, though, what we observe is not so much the world as a whole
getting smaller , but most peoples’ social worlds growing more parochial,
their lives and passions more likely to be circumscribed by boundaries of
culture, class and language.
We might ask why all this has happened. What are the mechanisms that
cause human beings to spend so much ef fort trying to demonstrate that they
are dif ferent from their neighbours? This is an important question. W e shall
be considering it in much more detail in the following chapter .
For the moment, we simply note that the proliferation of separate social
and cultural universes – conﬁned in space and relatively bounded – must
have contributed in various ways to the emer gence of more durable and
intransigent forms of domination. The mixed composition of so many
foraging societies clearly indicates that individuals were routinely on the
move for a plethora of reasons, including taking the ﬁrst available exit route
if one’ s personal freedoms were threatened at home. Cultural porosity is
also necessary for the kind of seasonal demographic pulses that made it
possible for societies to alternate periodically between dif ferent political
arrangements, forming massive congregations at one time of year , then
dispersing into a multitude of smaller units for the remainder .
That is one reason why the majestic theatre of Palaeolithic ‘princely’
burials – or even of Stonehenge – never seems to have gone too far beyondtheatrics. Simply put, it’ s difﬁcult to exercise arbitrary power in, say ,
January over someone you will be facing on equal terms again come July .
The hardening and multiplication of cultural boundaries can only have
reduced such possibilities.
IN WHICH WE ASK WHA T, PRECISEL Y, IS EQUALIZED IN
‘EGALIT ARIAN’ SOCIETIES?
The emer gence of local cultural worlds during the Mesolithic made it more
likely that a relatively self-contained society might abandon seasonal
dispersal and settle into some kind of full-time, top-down, hierarchical
arrangement. In our terms, to get stuck. But of course, this in itself hardly
explains why any particular society did, in fact, get stuck in such
arrangements. W e are back to something not entirely dif ferent from the
‘origins of social inequality’ problem – but by now , we can at least focus a
little more sharply on what the problem really is.
As we have repeatedly observed, ‘inequality’ is a slippery term, so
slippery , in fact, that it’ s not entirely clear what the term ‘egalitarian
society’ should even mean. Usually , it’s deﬁned negatively: as the absence
of hierarchies (the belief that certain people or types of people are superior
to others), or as the absence of relations of domination or exploitation. This
is already quite complex, and the moment we try to deﬁne egalitarianism in
positive terms everything becomes much more so.
On the one hand, ‘egalitarianism’ (as opposed to ‘equality’, let alone
‘uniformity’ or ‘homogeneity’) seems to refer to the presence of some kind
of ideal. It’ s not just that an outside observer would tend to see all members
of, say , a Semang hunting party as pretty much interchangeable, like the
cannon-fodder minions of some alien overlord in a science ﬁction movie
(this would, in fact, be rather of fensive); but rather , that Semang themselves
feel they ought to be the same – not in every way , since that would be
ridiculous, but in the ways that really matter . It also implies that this ideal
is, lar gely, realized. So, as a ﬁrst approximation, we can speak of an
egalitarian society if (1) most people in a given society feel they really
ought to be the same in some speciﬁc way , or ways, that are agreed to be
particularly important; and (2) that ideal can be said to be lar gely achieved
in practice.Another way to put this might be as follows. If all societies are or ganized
around certain key values (wealth, piety , beauty , freedom, knowledge,
warrior prowess), then ‘egalitarian societies’ are those where everyone (or
almost everyone) agrees that the paramount values should be, and generally
speaking are, distributed equally . If wealth is what’ s considered the most
important thing in life, then everyone is more or less equally wealthy . If
learning is most valued, then everyone has equal access to knowledge. If
what’ s most important is one’ s relationship with the gods, then a society is
egalitarian if there are no priests and everyone has equal access to places of
worship.
You may have noticed an obvious problem here. Dif ferent societies
sometimes have radically dif ferent systems of value, and what might be
most important in one – or at least, what everyone insists is most important
in one – might have very little to do with what’ s important in another .
Imagine a society in which everyone is equal before the gods, but 50 per
cent of the population are sharecroppers with no property and therefore no
legal or political rights. Does it really make sense to call this an ‘egalitarian
society’ – even if everyone, including the sharecroppers, insists that it’ s
really only one’ s relation to the gods that is ultimately important?
There’ s only one way out of this dilemma: to create some sort of
universal, objective standards by which to measure equality . Since the time
of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith, this has almost invariably
meant focusing on property arrangements. As we’ve seen, it was only at
this point, in the mid to late eighteenth century , that European philosophers
ﬁrst came up with the idea of ranking human societies according to their
means of subsistence, and therefore that hunter -gatherers should be treated
as a distinct variety of human being. As we’ve also seen, this idea is very
much still with us. But so is Rousseau’ s argument that it was only the
invention of agriculture that introduced genuine inequality , since it allowed
for the emer gence of landed property . This is one of the main reasons
people today continue to write as if foragers can be assumed to live in
egalitarian bands to begin with – because it’ s also assumed that without the
productive assets (land, livestock) and stockpiled surpluses (grain, wool,
dairy products, etc.) made possible by farming, there was no real material
basis for anyone to lord it over anyone else.
Conventional wisdom also tells us that the moment a material surplus
does become possible, there will also be full-time craft specialists, warriorsand priests laying claim to it, and living of f some portions of that surplus
(or, in the case of warriors, spending the bulk of their time trying to ﬁgure
out new ways to steal it from each other); and before long, merchants,
lawyers and politicians will inevitably follow . These new elites will, as
Rousseau emphasized, band together to protect their assets, so the advent of
private property will be followed, inexorably , by the rise of ‘the state’.
We will scrutinize this conventional wisdom in more detail later . For
now, sufﬁce to say that while there is a broad truth here, it is so broad as to
have very little explanatory power . For sure, only cereal-farming and grain
storage made possible bureaucratic regimes like those of Pharaonic Egypt,
the Maurya Empire or Han China. But to say that cereal-farming was
responsible for the rise of such states is a little like saying that the
development of calculus in medieval Persia is responsible for the invention
of the atom bomb. It is true that without calculus atomic weaponry would
never have been possible. One might even make a case that the invention of
calculus set of f a chain of events that made it likely someone, somewhere,
would eventually create nuclear weapons. But to assert that Al-T usi’s work
on polynomials in the 1 100s caused  Hiroshima and Nagasaki is clearly
absurd. Similarly , with agriculture. Roughly 6,000 years stand between the
appearance of the ﬁrst farmers in the Middle East and the rise of what we
are used to calling the ﬁrst states; and in many parts of the world, farming
never led to the emer gence of anything remotely like those states.7
At this juncture, we need to focus on the very notion of a surplus, and the
much broader – almost existential – questions it raises. As philosophers
realized long ago, this is a concept that poses fundamental questions about
what it means to be human. One of the things that sets us apart from non-
human animals is that animals produce only and exactly what they need;
humans invariably produce more. W e are creatures of excess, and this is
what makes us simultaneously the most creative, and most destructive, of
all species. Ruling classes are simply those who have or ganized society in
such a way that they can extract the lion’ s share of that surplus for
themselves, whether through tribute, slavery , feudal dues or manipulating
ostensibly free-market arrangements.
In the nineteenth century , Marx and many of his fellow radicals did
imagine that it was possible to administer such a surplus collectively , in an
equitable fashion (this is what he envisioned as being the norm under
‘primitive communism’, and what he thought could once again be possiblein the revolutionary future), but contemporary thinkers tend to be more
sceptical. In fact, the dominant view among anthropologists nowadays is
that the only way to maintain a truly egalitarian society is to eliminate the
possibility of accumulating any sort of surplus at all.
The greatest modern authority on hunter -gatherer egalitarianism is, by
general consent, the British anthropologist James W oodburn. In the post-
war decades W oodburn conducted research among the Hadza, a forager
society of T anzania. He also drew parallels between them and the San
Bushmen and Mbuti Pygmies, as well as a number of other small-scale
nomadic forager societies outside Africa, such as the Pandaram of south
India or Batek of Malaysia.8 Such societies are, W oodburn suggests, the
only genuinely egalitarian societies we know of, since they are the only
ones that extend equality to gender relations and, as much as is practicable,
to relations between old and young.
Focusing on such societies allowed W oodburn to sidestep the question of
what is being equalized and what isn’ t, because populations like the Hadza
appear to apply principles of equality to just about everything it is possible
to apply them to: not just material possessions, which are constantly being
shared out or passed around, but herbal or sacred knowledge, prestige
(talented hunters are systematically mocked and belittled), and so on. All
such behaviour , Woodburn insisted, is based on a self-conscious ethos, that
no one should ever be in a relation of ongoing dependency to anybody else.
This echoes what we heard in the last chapter from Christopher Boehm
about the ‘actuarial intelligence’ of egalitarian hunter -gatherers, but
Woodburn adds a twist: the real deﬁning feature of such societies is,
precisely , the lack of any material surplus.
Truly egalitarian societies, for W oodburn, are those with ‘immediate
return’ economies: food brought home is eaten the same day or the next;
anything extra is shared out, but never preserved or stored. All this is in
stark contrast to most foragers, and all pastoralists or farmers, who can be
characterized as having ‘delayed return’ economies, regularly investing
their ener gies in projects that only bear fruit at some point in the future.
Such investments, he ar gues, inevitably lead to ongoing ties that can
become the basis for some individuals to exercise power over others; what’ s
more, W oodburn assumes a certain ‘actuarial intelligence’ – Hadza and
other egalitarian foragers understand all this perfectly well, and as a resultthey self-consciously avoid stockpiling resources or engaging in any long-
term projects.
Far from rushing blindly for their chains like Rousseau’ s savages,
Woodburn’ s ‘immediate return hunter -gatherers’ understand precisely
where the chains of captivity loom, and or ganize much of their lives to keep
away from them. This might sound like the basis of something hopeful or
optimistic. Actually , it’s anything but. What it suggests is, again, that any
equality worth the name is essentially impossible for all but the very
simplest foragers. What kind of future might we then have in store? At best,
we could perhaps imagine (with the invention of Star T rek replicators or
other immediate-gratiﬁcation devices) that it might be possible, at some
point in the distant future, to create something like a society of equals once
more. But in the meantime, we are deﬁnitively stuck. In other words, this is
the Garden of Eden narrative all over again – just, this time, with the bar for
paradise set even higher .
What’ s really striking about W oodburn’ s vision is that the foragers he
focuses on appear to have reached such profoundly dif ferent conclusions
from Kandiaronk, and several generations of First Nation critics before him,
all of whom had trouble even imagining that dif ferences of wealth could be
translated into systematic inequalities of power . Recall that the American
indigenous critique, as we described it in Chapter T wo, was initially about
something very dif ferent: the perceived failure of European societies to
promote mutual aid and protect personal liberties. Only later , once
indigenous intellectuals had more exposure to the workings of French and
English society , did it come to focus on inequalities of property . Perhaps we
should follow their initial train of thought.
Few anthropologists are particularly happy with the term ‘egalitarian
societies’, for reasons that should now be obvious; but it lingers on because
no one has suggested a compelling alternative. The closest we’re aware of
is the feminist anthropologist Eleanor Leacock’ s suggestion that most
members of what are called egalitarian societies seem less interested in
equality per se than what she calls ‘autonomy’. What matters to
Montagnais-Naskapi women, for instance, is not so much whether men and
women are seen to be of equal status but whether women are, individually
or collectively , able to live their lives and make their own decisions without
male interference.9In other words, if there is a value these women feel should be distributed
equally , it is precisely what we would refer to as ‘freedom’. Perhaps the
best thing, then, would be to call these ‘free societies’; or even, following
the Jesuit Father Lallemant’ s verdict on the Montagnais-Naskapi’ s Wendat
neighbours, ‘free people’, each of whom ‘considers himself of as much
consequence as the others; and they submit to their chiefs only in so far as it
pleases them.’10 At ﬁrst glance, W endat society , with its elaborate
constitutional structure of chiefs, speakers and other ofﬁce holders, might
not seem an obvious choice for inclusion on a list of ‘egalitarian’ societies.
But ‘chiefs’ are not really chiefs if they have no means to enforce orders.
Equality , in societies such as those of the W endat, was a direct consequence
of individual liberty . Of course, the same can be said in reverse: liberties are
not really liberties if one cannot act on them. Most people today also
believe they live in free societies (indeed, they often insist that, politically
at least, this is what is most important about their societies), but the
freedoms which form the moral basis of a nation like the United States are,
largely, formal  freedoms.
American citizens have the right to travel wherever they like – provided,
of course, they have the money for transport and accommodation. They are
free from ever having to obey the arbitrary orders of superiors – unless, of
course, they have to get a job. In this sense, it is almost possible to say the
Wendat had play chiefs1 1 and real freedoms, while most of us today have
to make do with real chiefs and play freedoms. Or to put the matter more
technically: what the Hadza, W endat or ‘egalitarian’ people such as the
Nuer seem to have been concerned with were not so much formal  freedoms
as substantive  ones.12 They were less interested in the right to travel than
in the possibility of actually doing so (hence, the matter was typically
framed as an obligation to provide hospitality to strangers). Mutual aid –
what contemporary European observers often referred to as ‘communism’ –
was seen as the necessary condition for individual autonomy .
This might help explain at least some of the apparent confusion around
the term egalitarianism: it is possible for explicit hierarchies to emer ge, but
to nonetheless remain lar gely theatrical, or to conﬁne themselves to very
limited aspects of social life. Let us return for a moment to the Sudanese
Nuer . Ever since the Oxford social anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard
published his classic ethnography of them in the 1940s, the Nuer were held
out as the very paradigm for ‘egalitarian’ societies in Africa. They hadnothing even remotely resembling institutions of government and were
notorious for the high value they placed on personal independence. But by
the 1960s, feminist anthropologists like Kathleen Gough were showing that,
again, you couldn’ t really speak of equality of status here: males in Nuer
communities were divided between ‘aristocrats’ (with ancestral connections
to the territories where they live), ‘strangers’ and lowly war captives taken
by force in raids on other communities. Neither were these purely formal
distinctions. While Evans-Pritchard had written of f such dif ferences as
inconsequential, in reality , as Gough noted, dif ference in rank implied
differential access to women. Only the aristocrats could easily assemble
enough cattle to arrange what Nuer considered a ‘proper ’ marriage – that is,
one in which they could claim paternity over the children and thus be
remembered as ancestors after their death.13
So was Evans-Pritchard simply wrong? Not exactly . In fact, while rank
and dif ferential access to cattle became relevant when people were
arranging marriages, they had almost no bearing in any other
circumstances. It would have been impossible, even at a formal event like a
dance or sacriﬁce, to determine who was ‘above’ anyone else. Most
importantly , differences in wealth (cattle) never translated into the ability to
give orders, or to demand formal obeisance. In an often-cited passage
Evans-Pritchard wrote:
That every Nuer considers himself as good as his neighbour is
evident in their every movement. They strut about like lords of the
earth, which, indeed, they consider themselves to be. There is no
master and no servant in their society , but only equals who regard
themselves as God’ s noblest creation … even the suspicion of an
order riles a man and he either does not carry it out or he carries it
out in a casual and dilatory manner that is more insulting than a
refusal.14
Evans-Pritchard is referring here to men. What about women?
While in everyday af fairs, Gough found, women operated with much the
same independence as men, the marriage system did ef face women’ s
freedom to a degree. If a man paid the forty cattle typically required for
bridewealth, this meant above all that he not only had the right to claim
paternity over a woman’ s children but also acquired exclusive sexualaccess, which in turn usually meant the right to interfere with his wife’ s
affairs in other respects as well. However , most Nuer women were not
‘properly’ married. In fact, the complexities of the system were such that a
large proportion found themselves ofﬁcially married to ghosts, or to other
women (who could be declared male for genealogical purposes) – in which
case, how they went about becoming pregnant and raising their children
was nobody’ s business but their own. Even in sexual life, then, for women
as for men, individual freedom was assumed unless there was some speciﬁc
reason to curtail it.
The freedom to abandon one’ s community , knowing one will be welcomed
in faraway lands; the freedom to shift back and forth between social
structures, depending on the time of year; the freedom to disobey
authorities without consequence – all appear to have been simply assumed
among our distant ancestors, even if most people ﬁnd them barely
conceivable today . Humans may not have begun their history in a state of
primordial innocence, but they do appear to have begun it with a self-
conscious aversion to being told what to do.15 If this is so, we can at least
reﬁne our initial question: the real puzzle is not when chiefs, or even kings
and queens, ﬁrst appeared, but rather when it was no longer possible simply
to laugh them out of court.
Now it is undoubtedly true that, over the broad sweep of history , we ﬁnd
ever lar ger and more settled populations, ever more powerful forces of
production, ever lar ger material surpluses, and people spending ever more
of their time under someone else’ s command. It seems reasonable to
conclude there is some sort of connection between these trends. But the
nature of that connection, and the actual mechanisms, are entirely unclear .
In contemporary societies we consider ourselves free people lar gely
because we lack political overlords. For us, it’ s simply assumed that what
we call ‘the economy’ is or ganized entirely dif ferently , on the basis not of
freedom but ‘efﬁciency’, and therefore that ofﬁces and shop ﬂoors are
typically arranged in strict chains of command. Unsurprising, then, that so
much current speculation on the origins of inequality focuses on economic
changes, and particularly the world of work.
Here too, we think, much of the available evidence has been widely
misconstrued.A focus on work is not precisely the same as a focus on property , though
if one is trying to understand how control of property ﬁrst came to be
translated into power of command, the world of work would be the obvious
place to look. By framing the stages of human development lar gely around
the ways people went about acquiring food, men like Adam Smith and
Turgot inevitably put work – previously considered a somewhat plebeian
concern – centre stage. There was a simple reason for this. It allowed them
to claim that their own societies were self-evidently superior , a claim that –
at the time – would have been much harder to defend had they used any
criterion other than productive labour .16
Turgot and Smith began writing this way in the 1750s. They referred to
the apex of development as ‘commercial society’, in which a complex
division of labour demanded the sacriﬁce of primitive liberties but
guaranteed dazzling increases in overall wealth and prosperity . Over the
next several decades, the invention of the spinning jenny , Arkwright loom
and, eventually , steam and coal power – and ﬁnally the emer gence of a
permanent (and increasingly self-conscious) industrial working class –
completely shifted the terms of debate. Suddenly , there existed forces of
production previously undreamed of. But there was also a staggering
increase in the number of hours that people were expected to work. In the
new mills, twelve- to ﬁfteen-hour days and six-day weeks were considered
standard; holidays were minimal. (John Stuart Mill protested that ‘All the
labour -saving machinery that has hitherto been invented has not lessened
the toil of a single human being.’)
As a result, and over the course of the nineteenth century , almost
everyone ar guing about the overall direction of human civilization took it
for granted that technological progress was the prime mover of history , and
that if progress was the story of human liberation, this could only mean
liberation from ‘unnecessary toil’: at some future time, science would
eventually free us from at least the most degrading, onerous and soul-
destroying forms of work. In fact, by the V ictorian era many began ar guing
that this was already happening. Industrialized farming and new labour -
saving devices, they claimed, were already leading us towards a world
where everyone would enjoy an existence of leisure and afﬂuence – and
where we wouldn’ t have to spend most of our waking lives running about at
someone else’ s orders.Granted, this must have seemed a bizarre claim to radical trade unionists
in Chicago who, as late as the 1880s, had to engage in pitched battles with
police and company detectives in order to win an eight-hour day – that is,
obtain the right to a daily work regime that the average medieval baron
would have considered unreasonable to expect of his serfs.17 Yet, perhaps
as a riposte to such campaigns, V ictorian intellectuals began ar guing that
exactly the opposite was true: ‘primitive man’, they posited, had been
engaged in a constant struggle for his very existence; life in early human
societies was a perpetual chore. European or Chinese or Egyptian peasants
toiled from dawn till dusk to eke out a living. And so, it followed, even the
awful work regimes of the Dickensian age were actually an improvement
on what had come before. All we are ar guing about, they insisted, is the
pace of improvement. By the dawn of the twentieth century , such reasoning
had become universally accepted as common sense.
That is what made Marshall Sahlins’ s 1968 essay ‘The Original Afﬂuent
Society’ such an epochal event, and is why we must now consider both
some of its implications and its limitations. Probably the most inﬂuential
anthropological essay ever written, it turned that old V ictorian wisdom –
still prevalent in the 1960s – on its head, creating instant discussion and
debate, inspiring everyone from socialists to hippies. Whole schools of
thought (Primitivism, Degrowth) would likely have never come about
without it. But Sahlins was also writing at a time when archaeologists still
knew relatively little about pre-agricultural peoples, at least compared to
what we know now . It might be best, then, ﬁrst to take a look at his
argument before turning to the evidence we have today and seeing how the
piece measures up against it.
IN WHICH WE DISCUSS MARSHALL SAHLINS’S ‘ORIGINAL
AFFLUENT SOCIETY’ AND REFLECT ON WHA T CAN HAPPEN
WHEN EVEN VER Y INSIGHTFUL PEOPLE WRITE ABOUT
PREHIST ORY IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTUAL EVIDENCE
Marshall Sahlins started his career in the late 1950s as a neo-evolutionist.
When ‘The Original Afﬂuent Society’ was published, he was still most
famous for his work with Elman Service which proposed four stages of
human political development: from bands to tribes, chiefdoms and states.
All these terms are still widely used today . In 1968, Sahlins accepted aninvitation to spend a year in Claude Lévi-Strauss’ s laboratoir e in Paris,
where, he later reported, he used to eat lunch in the cafeteria each day with
Pierre Clastres (who would go on to write Society Against the State ),
arguing about ethnographic data and whether or not society was ripe for
revolution.
These were heady days in French universities, full of student
mobilizations and street ﬁghting that ultimately led up to the student/worker
insurrection of May 1968 (during which Lévi-Strauss maintained a haughty
neutrality , but Sahlins and Clastres became enthusiastic participants). In the
midst of all this political ferment, the nature of work, the need for work, the
refusal of work, the possibility of gradually eliminating work were all
heated matters of debate in both political and intellectual circles.
Sahlins’ s essay , perhaps the last truly great example of that genre of
‘speculative prehistory’ invented by Rousseau, ﬁrst appeared in Jean-Paul
Sartre’ s journal Les T emps modernes .18 It made the ar gument that, at least
when it comes to working hours, the V ictorian narrative of continual
improvement is simply backwards. T echnological evolution has not
liberated people from material necessity . People are not working less. All
the evidence, he ar gued, suggests that over the course of human history the
overall number of hours most people spend working has tended instead to
increase. Even more provocatively , Sahlins insisted that people in earlier
ages were not, necessarily , poorer than modern-day consumers. In fact, he
contended, for much of our early history humans might just as easily be
said to have lived lives of great material abundance.
True, a forager might seem extremely poor by our standards – but to
apply our standards was obviously ridiculous. ‘Abundance’ is not an
absolute measure. It refers to a situation where one has easy access to
everything one feels one needs to live a happy and comfortable life. By
those standards, Sahlins ar gued, most known foragers are rich. The fact that
many hunter -gatherers, and even horticulturalists, only seem to have spent
somewhere between two and four hours a day doing anything that could be
construed as ‘work’ was itself proof of how easy their needs were to satisfy .
Before continuing, it’ s worth saying that the broad picture Sahlins
presented appears to be correct. As we pointed out above, the average
oppressed medieval serf still worked less than a modern nine-to-ﬁve ofﬁce
or factory worker , and the hazelnut gatherers and cattle herders who
dragged great slabs to build Stonehenge almost certainly worked, onaverage, less than that. It’ s only very recently that even the richest countries
have begun to turn such things around (obviously , most of us are not
working as many hours as V ictorian stevedores, though the overall decline
in working hours is probably not as dramatic as we think). And for much of
the world’ s population, things are still getting worse instead of better .
What stands the test of time less well is the image that most readers take
away from Sahlins’ s essay: of happy-go-lucky hunter -gatherers, spending
most of their time lounging in the shade, ﬂirting, forming drum circles or
telling stories. And this has everything to do with the ethnographic
examples he was drawing on, lar gely the San, Mbuti and Hadza.
In the last chapter , we suggested a number of reasons why !Kung San
(Bushmen) on the mar gins of the Kalahari and Hadza of the Serengeti
Plateau became so popular in the 1960s as exemplars of what early human
society might have been like (despite being quite unusual, as foragers go).
One reason was simply the availability of data: by the 1960s, they were
among the only foraging populations left who still maintained something
like their traditional mode of life. It was also in this decade that
anthropologists started carrying out time-allocation studies, recording
systematically what members of dif ferent societies do over the course of a
typical day and how much time they spend doing it.19 Such research with
African foragers also seemed to resonate with the famous discoveries of
fossil hominins then being made by Louis and Mary Leakey in other parts
of the continent, such as Olduvai Gor ge in T anzania. Since some of these
modern hunter -gatherers were living in savannah-like environments, not
unlike the ones in which our species now appeared to have evolved, it was
tempting to imagine that here – in these living populations – one might
catch a glimpse of human society in something like its original state.
Moreover , the results of those early time-allocation studies came as an
enormous surprise. It’ s worth bearing in mind that, in the post-war decades,
most anthropologists and archaeologists still very much took for granted the
old nineteenth-century narrative of humanity’ s primordial ‘struggle for
existence’. T o our ears, much of the rhetoric commonplace at the time, even
among the most sophisticated scholars, sounds startlingly condescending:
‘A man who spends his whole life following animals just to kill them to
eat,’ wrote the prehistorian Robert Braidwood in 1957, ‘or moving from
one berry patch to another , is really living just like an animal himself.’20Yet these ﬁrst quantitative studies comprehensively disproved such
pronouncements. They showed that, even in quite inhospitable
environments like the deserts of Namibia or Botswana, foragers could
easily feed everyone in their group and still have three to ﬁve days per week
left for engaging in such extremely human activities as gossiping, ar guing,
playing games, dancing or travelling for pleasure.
Researchers in the 1960s were also beginning to realize that, far from
agriculture being some sort of remarkable scientiﬁc advance, foragers (who
after all tended to be intimately familiar with all aspects of the growing
cycles of food plants) were perfectly aware of how one might go about
planting and harvesting grains and vegetables. They just didn’ t see any
reason why they should. ‘Why should we plant,’ one !Kung informant put it
– in a phrase cited ever since in a thousand treatises on the origins of
farming – ‘when there are so many mongongo nuts in the world?’ Indeed,
concluded Sahlins, what some prehistorians had assumed to be technical
ignorance was really a self-conscious social decision: such foragers had
‘rejected the Neolithic Revolution in order to keep their leisure’.21
Anthropologists were still struggling to come to terms with all this when
Sahlins stepped in to draw the lar ger conclusions.
The ancient forager ethos of leisure (the ‘Zen road to afﬂuence’) only
broke down, or so Sahlins surmised, when people ﬁnally – for whatever
reasons – began to settle in one place and accept the toils of agriculture.
They did so at a terrible cost. It wasn’ t just ever -increasing hours of toil that
followed but, for most, poverty , disease, war and slavery – all fuelled by
endless competition and the mindless pursuit of new pleasures, new powers
and new forms of wealth. W ith one deft move, Sahlins’ s ‘Original Afﬂuent
Society’ used the results of time-allocation studies to pull the rug from
under the traditional story of human civilization. Like W oodburn, Sahlins
brushes aside Rousseau’ s version of the Fall – the idea that, too foolish to
reﬂect on the likely consequences of our actions in assembling, stockpiling
and guarding property , we ‘ran blindly for our chains’22 – and takes us
straight back to the Garden of Eden. If rejecting farming was a conscious
choice, then so was that act of embracing it. W e chose to eat of the fruit of
the tree of knowledge, and for this we were punished. As St Augustine put
it, we rebelled against God, and God’ s judgment was to cause our own
desires to rebel against our rational good sense; our punishment for original
sin is the inﬁnity of our new desires.23If there is a fundamental dif ference here from the biblical story , it’s that
the Fall (according to Sahlins) didn’ t happen just once. W e didn’ t collapse
and then begin slowly to pull ourselves back up. When it comes to labour
and afﬂuence, every new technological breakthrough seems to cause us to
fall yet further .
Sahlins’ s piece is a brilliant morality tale. There is, however , one obvious
ﬂaw. The whole ar gument for an ‘original afﬂuent society’ rested on a
single fragile premise: that most prehistoric humans really did live in the
speciﬁc manner of African foragers. As Sahlins was perfectly willing to
admit, this was just a guess. In closing his essay , he asked whether
‘marginal hunters such as the Bushmen of the Kalahari’ really were any
more representative of the Palaeolithic condition than the foragers of
California (who placed great value on hard work) or the Northwest Coast
(with their ranked societies and stockpiles of wealth)? Perhaps not, Sahlins
conceded.24 This often overlooked observation is crucial. It’ s not that
Sahlins is suggesting that his own phrase ‘original afﬂuent society’ is
incorrect. Rather , he acknowledges that, just as there might have been many
ways for free peoples to be free, there might have been more than just one
way for (original) afﬂuent societies to be afﬂuent.
Not all modern hunter -gatherers value leisure over hard work, just as not
all share the easy-going attitudes towards personal possessions of the !Kung
or Hadza. Foragers in northwestern California, for instance, were notorious
for their cupidity , organizing much of their lives around the accumulation of
shell money and sacred treasures and adhering to a stringent work ethic in
order to do so. The ﬁsher -foragers of the Canadian Northwest Coast, on the
other hand, lived in highly stratiﬁed societies where commoners and slaves
were famously industrious. According to one of their ethnographers, the
Kwakiutl of V ancouver Island were not only well housed and fed, but
lavishly supplied: ‘Each household made and possessed many mats, boxes,
cedar -bark and fur blankets, wooden dishes, horn spoons, and canoes. It
was as though in manufacturing as well as in food production there was no
point at which further expenditure of ef fort in the production of more of the
same items was felt to be superﬂuous.’25 Not only did the Kwakiutl
surround themselves with endless piles of possessions, but they also put
endless creativity into designing and crafting them, with results so striking
and intricately beautiful as to make them the pride of ethnographicmuseums the world over . (Lévi-Strauss remarked that turn-of-the-century
Kwakiutl were like a society where a dozen dif ferent Picassos were
operative all at the same time.) This, surely , is a kind of afﬂuence. But one
entirely dif ferent from that of the !Kung or Mbuti.
Which, then, more resembled the original state of human af fairs: the
easy-going Hadza, or the industrious foragers of northwestern California?
By now it will be clear to the reader that this is just the kind of question we
shouldn’ t be asking. There was no truly ‘original’ state of af fairs. Anyone
who insists that one exists is by deﬁnition trading in myths (Sahlins, at
least, was fairly honest about this). Human beings had many tens of
thousands of years to experiment with dif ferent ways of life, long before
any of them turned their hands to agriculture. Instead we might do better to
look at the overall direction of change, so as to understand how it bears on
our question: how humans came lar gely to lose the ﬂexibility and freedom
that seems once to have characterized our social arrangements, and ended
up stuck in permanent relations of dominance and subordination.
To do this means continuing the story begun in Chapter Three , following
our foraging ancestors out of the Ice Age (or Pleistocene era) into a phase
of warmer global climate known as the Holocene. This will also take us far
outside Europe, to places like Japan and the Caribbean coast of North
America, where entirely new and unsuspected pasts are beginning to
emer ge; ones which – despite the stubborn ef forts of scholars to shoehorn
them into neat evolutionary boxes – look about as far from small, nomadic,
egalitarian ‘bands’ as one can possibly imagine.
IN WHICH WE SHOW HOW NEW DISCOVERIES CONCERNING
ANCIENT HUNTER-GA THERERS IN NOR TH AMERICA AND
JAPAN ARE TURNING SOCIAL EVOLUTION ON ITS HEAD
In modern-day Louisiana there is a place with the dispiriting name of
Poverty Point. Here you can still see the remains of massive earthworks
erected by Native Americans around 1600 BC. With its plush green lawns
and well-trained coppices, today the site looks like something halfway
between a wildlife management area and a golf club.26 Grass-covered
mounds and ridges rise neatly from carefully tended meadows, forming
concentric rings which suddenly vanish where the Bayou Macon has eroded
them away ( bayou  being derived, via Louisiana French, from the Choctawword bayuk : marshy rivulets spreading out from the main channel of the
Mississippi). Despite nature’ s best ef forts to obliterate these earthworks,
and early European settlers’ best ef forts to deny their obvious signiﬁcance
(perhaps these were the dwellings of an ancient race of giants, they
conjectured, or one of the lost tribes of Israel?), they endure: evidence for
an ancient civilization of the Lower Mississippi and testimony to the scale
of its accomplishments.
Archaeologists believe these structures at Poverty Point formed a
monumental precinct that once extended over 200 hectares, ﬂanked by two
enormous earthen mounds (the so-called Motley and Lower Jackson
Mounds) which lie respectively north and south. T o clarify what this means,
it’s worth noting that the ﬁrst Eurasian cities – early centres of civic life like
Uruk in southern Iraq, or Harappa in the Punjab – began as settlements of
roughly 200 hectares in total. Which is to say that their entire layout could
ﬁt quite comfortably within the ceremonial precinct of Poverty Point. Like
those early Eurasian cities, Poverty Point sprang from a great river , since
transport by water , particularly of bulk goods, was in early times inﬁnitely
easier than transport by land. Like them, it formed the core of a much lar ger
sphere of cultural interaction. People and resources came to Poverty Point
from hundreds of miles away , as far north as the Great Lakes and from the
Gulf of Mexico to the south.
Seen from the air – a ‘god’ s-eye’ view – Poverty Point’ s standing
remains look like some sunken, gar gantuan amphitheatre; a place of crowds
and power , worthy of any great agrarian civilization. Something
approaching a million cubic metres of soil was moved to create its
ceremonial infrastructure, which was most likely oriented to the skies, since
some of its mounds form enormous ﬁgures of birds, inviting the heavens to
bear witness to their presence. But the people of Poverty Point weren’ t
farmers. Nor did they use writing. They were hunters, ﬁshers and foragers,
exploiting a superabundance of wild resources (ﬁsh, deer , nuts, waterfowl)
in the lower reaches of the Mississippi. And they were not the ﬁrst hunter -
gatherers in this region to establish traditions of public architecture. These
traditions can be traced back far beyond Poverty Point itself, to around 3500
BC – which is also roughly the time that cities ﬁrst emer ged in Eurasia.
As archaeologists often point out, Poverty Point is ‘a Stone Age site in an
area where there is no stone’, so the staggering quantities of lithic tools,
weapons, vessels and lapidary ornaments found there must all have beenoriginally carried from somewhere else.27 The scale of its earthworks
implies thousands of people gathering at the site at particular times of year ,
in numbers outstripping any historically known hunter -gatherer population.
Much less clear is what attracted them there with their native copper , ﬂint,
quartz crystal, soapstone and other minerals; or how often they came, and
how long they stayed. W e simply don’ t know .
What we do know is that Poverty Point arrows and spearheads come in
rich hues of red, black, yellow and even blue stone, and these are only the
colours we discern. Ancient classiﬁcations were no doubt more reﬁned. If
stones were being selected with such care, we can only begin to imagine
what was going on with cords, ﬁbres, medicines and any living thing in the
landscape treated as potential food or poison. Another thing we can be quite
sure of is that ‘trade’ is not a useful way to describe whatever was going on
here. For one thing, trade goes two ways, and Poverty Point presents no
clear evidence for exports, or indeed commodities of any sort. The absence
is strikingly obvious to anyone who’ s studied the remains of early Eurasian
cities like Uruk and Harappa, which do seem to have been engaged in lively
trade relations: these sites are awash with industrial quantities of ceramic
packaging, and the products of their urban crafts are found far and wide.
Despite its great cultural reach, there is nothing at all of this commodity
culture at Poverty Point. In fact, it’ s not clear if anything much was going
out from the site, at least in material terms, other than certain enigmatic clay
items known as ‘cooking balls’, which can hardly be considered trade
goods. T extiles and fabrics may have been important, but we also have to
allow for the possibility that Poverty Point’ s greatest assets were intangible.
Most experts today view its monuments as expressions of sacred geometry ,
linked to calendar counts and the movement of celestial bodies. If anything
was being stockpiled at Poverty Point, it may well have been knowledge:
the intellectual property of rituals, vision quests, songs, dances and
images.28
We can’ t possibly know the details. But it’ s more than just speculation to
say that ancient foragers were exchanging complex information across this
entire region, and in a highly controlled fashion. Material proof comes from
close examination of the earthen monuments themselves. Through the great
valley of the Mississippi, and some considerable way beyond, there exist
other smaller sites of the same period. The various conﬁgurations of their
mounds and ridges adhere to strikingly uniform geometrical principles,based on standard units of measurement and proportion apparently shared
by early peoples throughout a signiﬁcant portion of the Americas. The
underlying system of calculus appears to have been based on the
transformational properties of equilateral triangles, ﬁgured out with the aid
of cords and strings, and then extended to the laying-out of massive
earthworks.
Published in 2004, this remarkable discovery by John E. Clark, an
archaeologist and authority on the pre-Columbian societies of
Mesoamerica,29 has been greeted by the scholarly community with
responses ranging from lukewarm acceptance to plain disbelief, although
nobody appears to have actually refuted it. Many prefer simply to ignore it.
Clark himself seems surprised by his results. W e will return to some wider
implications in Chapter Eleven, but for now we can simply note an
assessment of Clark’ s ﬁndings by two specialists in the ﬁeld, who accept the
evidence he presents ‘not only for a standard unit of measurement but also
for geometrical layouts and spacing intervals among ﬁrst-mound complexes
from Louisiana to Mexico and Peru, which incorporate multiples of that
standard’. At most, ﬁnding the same system of measurement across such
distances may prove to be ‘one of contemporary archaeology’ s most
provocative revelations’, and at the very least, they conclude, ‘those who
built the works were not simple, ordinary foragers.’30
Putting aside the (by now irrelevant) notion that there ever was such a
thing as ‘simple, ordinary foragers’, it has to be said that, even if Clark’ s
theory were true only for the Lower Mississippi and surrounding parts of
the Eastern W oodlands,31 it would still be quite remarkable. For , unless we
are dealing with some kind of amazing cosmic coincidence, it means that
someone had to convey knowledge of geometric and mathematical
techniques for making accurate spatial measurements, and related forms of
labour or ganization, over very long distances. If this were the case, it seems
likely that they also shared other forms of knowledge as well: cosmology ,
geology , philosophy , medicine, ethics, fauna, ﬂora, ideas about property ,
social structure, and aesthetics.
In the case of Poverty Point, should this be conceived as a form of
exchange of knowledge for material goods? Possibly . But the movement of
objects and ideas might have been or ganized any number of other ways as
well. All we know for sure is that the lack of an agricultural base does not
seem to have stopped those who gathered on Poverty Point from creatingsomething that to us would appear very much like little cities which, at least
during certain times of year , hosted a rich and inﬂuential intellectual life.
Today , Poverty Point is a National Park and Monument and UNESCO
World Heritage Site. Despite these designations of international importance,
its implications for world history have hardly begun to be explored. A
hunter -gatherer metropolis the size of a Mesopotamian city-state, Poverty
Point makes the Anatolian complex of Göbekli T epe look like little more
than a ‘potbelly hill’ (which is, in fact, what ‘Göbekli T epe’ means in
Turkish). Y et outside a small community of academic specialists, and of
course local residents and visitors, very few people have heard of it.
The obvious question at this juncture must surely be: why isn’ t Poverty
Point better known to audiences the world over? Why doesn’ t it feature
more prominently (or at all) in discussions on the origins of urban life,
centralization and their consequences for human history?
One reason, no doubt, is that Poverty Point and its predecessors (like the
much older mound complex at W atson’ s Brake, in the nearby Ouachita
basin) have been placed in a phase of American prehistory known as the
‘Archaic’. The Archaic period covers an immense span of time, between the
ﬂooding of the Beringia land bridge (which once linked Eurasia to the
Americas) around 8000 BC, and the initial adoption and spread of maize-
farming in certain parts of North America, down to around 1000 BC. One
word, for seven millennia of indigenous history . Archaeologists who ﬁrst
gave the period its name – which is really more of a chronological slap in
the face – were basically declaring, ‘this is the period before anything
particularly important was happening.’ So when undeniable evidence began
to appear that all sorts of important things were indeed happening, and not
just in the Mississippi basin, it was almost something of an archaeological
embarrassment.
On the shores of the Atlantic and around the Gulf of Mexico lie
enigmatic structures: just as remarkable as Poverty Point, but even less well
known. Formed out of shell in great accumulations, they range from small
rings to massive U-shaped ‘amphitheatres’ like those of St Johns River
valley in Northeast Florida. These were no natural features. They too were
built spaces where hunter -gatherer publics once assembled in their
thousands. Far to the north and west, on the other side of the continent,
more surprises loom up from the windswept shores of British Columbia:settlements and fortiﬁcations of striking magnitude, dating back as far as
2000 BC, facing a Paciﬁc already familiar with the spectacle of war and
long-range commerce.32
On the matter of hunter -gatherer history , North America isn’ t the only
part of the world where evolutionary expectations are heading for a titanic
collision with the archaeological record. In Japan and neighbouring islands,
another monolithic cultural designation – ‘Jōmon’ – holds sway over more
than 10,000 years of forager history , from around 14,000 BC to 300 BC.
Japanese archaeologists spend much time subdividing the Jōmon period in
ways just as intricate as the more pioneering North American scholars now
do with their ‘Archaic’. Everyone else, however , whether museumgoers or
readers of high-school textbooks, is still confronted with the stark
singularity of the term ‘Jōmon’, which, covering the long ages before rice-
farming came to Japan, leaves us with an impression of drab conservatism,
a time when nothing really happened. New archaeological discoveries are
now revealing just how wrong this is.
The creation of a new Japanese national past is a somewhat paradoxical
side ef fect of modernization. Since Japan’ s economic take-of f in the 1960s,
many thousands of archaeological sites have been discovered, excavated
and meticulously recorded, either as a result of construction projects for
roads, railways, housing or nuclear plants or as part of immense rescue
efforts undertaken in the wake of environmental catastrophes such as the
2011 Tōhoku earthquake. The result is an immense archive of
archaeological information. What begins to emer ge from this data-labyrinth
is an entirely dif ferent picture of what society was like before irrigated rice
cultivation came to Japan from the Korean Peninsula.
Across the Japanese archipelago, between 14,000 and 300 BC, centennial
cycles of settlement nucleation and dispersal came and went; monuments
shot up in wood and stone, and then were pulled down again or abandoned;
elaborate ritual traditions, including opulent burials, ﬂourished and
declined; specialized crafts waxed and waned, including remarkable
accomplishments in the arts of pottery , wood and lacquer . In traditions of
wild food procurement, strong regional contrasts are evident, ranging from
maritime adaptations to acorn-based economies, both using lar ge storage
facilities for gathered resources. Cannabis came into use, for ﬁbres and
recreational drug use. There were enormous villages with grand storehousesand what seem to be ritual precincts, such as those found at Sannai
Maruyama.33
An entire, for gotten social history of pre-agricultural Japan is resurfacing,
for now lar gely as a mass of data points and state heritage archives. In
future, as the bits get pieced back together , who knows what will come into
view?
Europe, too, bears witness to the vibrant and complex history of non-
agricultural peoples after the Ice Age. T ake the monuments called in
Finnish Jätinkirkko , the ‘Giants’ Churches’ of the Bothnian Sea between
Sweden and Finland: great stone ramparts, some up to 195 feet long, raised
up in their tens by coastal foragers between 3000 and 2000 BC. Or the ‘Big
Idol’, a seventeen-foot-tall totem pole with elaborate carvings rescued from
a peat bog on the shores of Lake Shigirskoe, on the eastern slopes of the
Central Urals. Dating to around 8000 BC, the Idol is the lone survivor of a
long-lost tradition of lar ge-scale wooden forager art which once produced
monuments that presided over northern skies. Then come the amber -soaked
burials of Karelia and southern Scandinavia, with their elaborate grave
goods and corpses staged in expressive poses, echoing some for gotten
etiquette of Mesolithic vintage.34 And, as we’ve seen, even the major
building phases of Stonehenge, long associated with early farmers, are now
dated to a time when cereal cultivation was virtually abandoned and
hazelnut-gathering once again took over in the British Isles, alongside
livestock-herding.
Back in North America, some researchers are beginning to talk, a little
awkwardly , of the ‘New Archaic’, a hitherto unsuspected era of
‘monuments without kings’.35 But the truth is that we still know precious
little of the political systems lying behind a now almost globally attested
phenomenon of forager monumentality , or indeed whether some of those
monumental projects might have involved kings or other kinds of leaders.
What we do know is that this changes forever the nature of the conversation
about social evolution in the Americas, Japan, Europe, and no doubt most
other places too. Clearly , foragers didn’ t shufﬂe backstage at the close of
the last Ice Age, waiting in the wings for some group of Neolithic farmers
to reopen the theatre of history . Why , then, is this new knowledge so rarely
integrated into our accounts of the human past? Why does almost everyone
(everyone, at least, who is not a specialist on Archaic North America orJōmon Japan) still write as if such things were impossible before the
coming of agriculture?
Of course, those of us with no access to archaeological reports can be
excused. What information exists more widely tends to be restricted to
scattered, and sometimes sensationalized, news summaries that are very
hard to put together into a single picture. Scholars and professional
researchers, on the other hand, have to actually make a considerable ef fort
to remain so ignorant. Let us consider for a moment some of the peculiar
forms of intellectual acrobatics required.
HOW THE MYTH THA T FORAGERS LIVE IN A ST ATE OF
INFANTILE SIMPLICITY IS KEPT ALIVE T ODA Y (OR,
INFORMAL F ALLACIES)
Let’s ﬁrst ask why even some experts apparently ﬁnd it so difﬁcult to shake
off the idea of the carefree, idle forager band; and the twin assumption that
‘civilization’ properly so called – towns, specialized craftspeople,
specialists in esoteric knowledge – would be impossible without
agriculture. Why would anyone continue to write history as if places like
Poverty Point could never have existed? It can’ t just be the whimsical result
of airy academic terminologies (‘Archaic’, ‘Jōmon’ and so on). The real
answer , we suggest, has more to do with the legacy of European colonial
expansion; and in particular its impact on both indigenous and European
systems of thought, especially with regard to the expression of rights of
property in land.
Recall how – long before Sahlins’ s notion of the ‘original afﬂuent
society’ – indigenous critics of European civilization were already ar guing
that hunter -gatherers were really better of f than other people because they
could obtain the things they wanted and needed so easily . Such views can
be found as early as the sixteenth century – remember , for instance, the
Mi’kmaq interlocutors who annoyed Père Biard so much by insisting they
were richer than the French, for exactly that reason. Kandiaronk made
similar ar guments, insisting ‘the Savages of Canada, notwithstanding their
Poverty , are richer than you, among whom all sorts of crimes are committed
upon the score of Mine and Thine.’36
As we’ve seen, indigenous critics like Kandiaronk, caught in the
rhetorical moment, would frequently overstate their case, even playingalong with the idea that they were blissful, innocent children of nature.
They did this in order to expose what they considered the bizarre
perversions of the European lifestyle. The irony is that, in doing so, they
often played into the hands of those who ar gued that – being blissful and
innocent children of nature – they also had no natural rights to their land.
Here it’ s important to understand a little of the legal basis for
dispossessing people who had the misfortune already to be living in
territories coveted by European settlers. This was, almost invariably , what
nineteenth-century jurists came to call the ‘Agricultural Ar gument’, a
principle which has played a major role in the displacement of untold
thousands of indigenous peoples from ancestral lands in Australia, New
Zealand, sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas: processes typically
accompanied by the rape, torture and mass murder of human beings, and
often the destruction of entire civilizations.
Colonial appropriation of indigenous lands often began with some
blanket assertion that foraging peoples really were living in a State of
Nature – which meant that they were deemed to be part of the land but had
no legal claims to own it. The entire basis for dispossession, in turn, was
premised on the idea that the current inhabitants of those lands weren’ t
really  working. The ar gument goes back to John Locke’ s Second T reatise of
Government  (1690), in which he ar gued that property rights are necessarily
derived from labour . In working the land, one ‘mixes one’ s labour ’ with it;
in this way it becomes, in a sense, an extension of oneself. Lazy natives,
according to Locke’ s disciples, didn’ t do that. They were not, Lockeans
claimed, ‘improving landlords’ but simply made use of the land to satisfy
their basic needs with the minimum of ef fort. James T ully, an authority on
indigenous rights, spells out the historical implications: land used for
hunting and gathering was considered vacant, and ‘if the Aboriginal peoples
attempt to subject the Europeans to their laws and customs or to defend the
territories that they have mistakenly believed to be their property for
thousands of years, then it is they who violate natural law and may be
punished or “destroyed” like savage beasts.’37 In a similar way , the
stereotype of the carefree, lazy native, coasting through a life free from
material ambition, was deployed by thousands of European conquerors,
plantation overseers and colonial ofﬁcials in Asia, Africa, Latin America
and Oceania as a pretext for the use of bureaucratic terror to force localpeople into work: everything from outright enslavement to punitive tax
regimes, corvée labour and debt peonage.
As indigenous legal scholars have been pointing out for years, the
‘Agricultural Ar gument’ makes no sense, even on its own terms. There are
many ways, other than European-style farming, in which to care for and
improve the productivity of land. What to a settler ’s eye seemed savage,
untouched wilderness usually turns out to be landscapes actively managed
by indigenous populations for thousands of years through controlled
burning, weeding, coppicing, fertilizing and pruning, terracing estuarine
plots to extend the habitat of particular wild ﬂora, building clam gardens in
intertidal zones to enhance the reproduction of shellﬁsh, creating weirs to
catch salmon, bass and stur geon, and so on. Such procedures were often
labour -intensive, and regulated by indigenous laws governing who could
access groves, swamps, root beds, grasslands and ﬁshing grounds, and who
was entitled to exploit what species at any given time of year . In parts of
Australia, these indigenous techniques of land management were such that,
according to one recent study , we should stop speaking of ‘foraging’
altogether , and refer instead to a dif ferent sort of farming.38
Such societies might not have recognized private property rights in the
same sense as Roman Law or English Common Law , but it’ s absurd to
argue they had no property rights at all. They simply had dif ferent
conceptions of property . This is true, incidentally , even of people like the
Hadza or !Kung; and, as we will see, many other foraging peoples actually
had extraordinarily complex and sophisticated conceptions of ownership.
Sometimes these indigenous property systems formed the basis for
differential access to resources, with the result that something like social
classes emer ged.39 Usually , though, this did not happen, because people
made sure that it didn’ t, much as they made sure chiefs did not develop
coercive power .
We should nonetheless recognize that the economic base of at least some
foraging societies was capable of supporting anything from priestly castes
to royal courts with standing armies. Let us take just one dramatic example
to illustrate the point.
One of the ﬁrst North American societies described by European explorers
in the sixteenth century were the Calusa, a non-agricultural people who
inhabited the west coast of Florida, from T ampa Bay to the Keys. Therethey had established a small kingdom, ruled from a capital town called
Calos, which today is marked by a thirty-hectare complex of high shell
mounds known as Mound Key . Fish, shellﬁsh and lar ger marine animals
comprised a major part of the Calusa diet, supplemented by deer , raccoon
and a variety of birds. Calusa also maintained a ﬂeet of war canoes with
which they would launch military raids on nearby populations, extracting
processed foods, skins, weapons, amber , metals and slaves as tribute. When
Juan Ponce de León entered Charlotte Harbor on 4 June 1513 he was met
by a well-or ganized ﬂotilla of such canoes, manned by heavily armed
hunter -gatherers.
Some historians resist calling the Calusa leader a ‘king’, preferring terms
like ‘paramount chief ’, but ﬁrst-hand accounts leave no doubt about his
exalted status. The man known as ‘Carlos’, the ruler of Calos at the time of
initial European contact, even looked like a European king: he wore a gold
diadem and beaded leg bands and sat on a wooden throne – and, crucially ,
he was the only Calusa allowed to do so. His powers seemed absolute. ‘His
will was law , and insubordination was punishable by death.’40 He was also
responsible for performing secret rituals that ensured the renewal of nature.
His subjects always greeted him by kneeling and raising their hands in a
gesture of obeisance, and he was typically accompanied by representatives
of the ruling class of warrior nobles and priests who, like him, devoted
themselves lar gely to the business of government. And he had at his
disposal the services of specialized craftsmen, including court metallur gists
who worked silver , gold and copper .
Spanish observers reported a traditional practice: that on the death of a
Calusa ruler , or of his principal wife, a certain quota of their subjects’ sons
and daughters had to be put to death. By most deﬁnitions, all this would
make Carlos not just a king, but a sacred king, perhaps divine.41 We know
less about the economic basis for these arrangements, but court life appears
to have been made possible not only by complex systems of access to
coastal ﬁshing grounds, which were exceedingly rich, but also by canals
and artiﬁcial ponds dug out of the coastal ever glades. The latter , in turn,
allowed for permanent – that is, non-seasonal – settlements (though most
Calusa did still scatter to ﬁshing and gathering sites at certain times of year ,
when the big towns grew decidedly smaller).42
By all accounts, then, the Calusa had indeed ‘got stuck’ in a single
economic and political mode that allowed extreme forms of inequality toemer ge. But they did so without ever planting a single seed or tethering a
single animal. Confronted with such cases, adherents of the view that
agriculture was a necessary foundation for durable inequalities have two
options: ignore them, or claim they represent some kind of insigniﬁcant
anomaly . Surely , they will say , foragers who do these kinds of things –
raiding their neighbours, stockpiling wealth, creating elaborate court
ceremonial, defending their territories and so on – aren’ t really foragers at
all, or at least not true foragers. Surely they must be farmers by other
means, ef fectively practising agriculture (just with wild crops), or perhaps
somehow caught in a moment of transition, ‘on the way’ to becoming
farmers, just not yet having quite arrived?
All these are excellent examples of what Antony Flew called the ‘No
True Scotsman’ style of ar gument (also known to logicians as the ‘ad hoc
rescue’ procedure). For those unfamiliar with it, it works like this:
Imagine Hamish McDonald, a Scotsman, sitting down with his
Glasgow Morning Herald  and seeing an article about how the
‘Brighton Sex Maniac Strikes Again’. Hamish is shocked and
declares that ‘No Scotsman would do such a thing.’ The next day he
sits down to read his Glasgow Morning Herald  again; and, this time,
ﬁnds an article about an Aberdeen man whose brutal actions make
the Brighton sex maniac seem almost gentlemanly . This fact shows
that Hamish was wrong in his opinion, but is he going to admit this?
Not likely . This time he says: ‘No true Scotsman would do such a
thing.’43
Philosophers frown on this style of ar gumentation as a classic ‘informal
fallacy’, or variety of circular ar gument. Y ou simply assert a proposition
(e.g. ‘hunter -gatherers do not have aristocracies’), then protect it from any
possible counter -examples by continually changing the deﬁnition. W e prefer
a consistent approach.
Foragers are populations which don’ t rely on biologically domesticated
plants and animals as their primary sources of food. Therefore, if it
becomes apparent that a good number of them have in fact possessed
complex systems of land tenure, or worshipped kings, or practised slavery ,
this altered picture of their activities doesn’ t somehow magically turn them
into ‘proto-farmers’. Nor does it justify the invention of endless sub-categories like ‘complex’ or ‘afﬂuent’ or ‘delayed-return’ hunter -gatherers,
which is simply another way of ensuring such peoples are kept in what the
Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolph T rouillot called the ‘savage slot’, their
histories deﬁned and circumscribed by their mode of subsistence – as if
they were people who really ought to be lazing around all day , but for some
reason got ahead of themselves.44 Instead, it means that the initial assertion
was, like that of the apocryphal Hamish McDonald, simply wrong.
IN WHICH WE DISPOSE OF ONE P ARTICULARL Y SILL Y
ARGUMENT THA T FORAGERS WHO SETTLE IN TERRIT ORIES
THA T LEND THEMSEL VES WELL T O FORAGING ARE
SOMEHOW UNUSUAL
In academic thought, there’ s another popular way of propping up the myth
of the ‘Agricultural Revolution’, and thereby writing of f people like the
Calusa as evolutionary quirks or anomalies. This is to claim that they only
behaved the way they did because they were living in ‘atypical’
environments. Usually , what’ s meant by ‘atypical’ are wetlands of various
sorts – coasts and river valleys – as opposed to the remoter corners of
tropical forests or desert mar gins, which is assumed to be where hunter -
gatherers really ought to be living, since that is where most of them live
today . It is a particularly weird ar gument, but a lot of very serious people
make it, so we’ll brieﬂy have to take it on.
Anyone who was still living mainly by hunting animals and gathering
wild foodstuf fs in the early to mid twentieth century was almost certainly
living on land no one else particularly wanted. That’ s why so many of the
best descriptions of foragers come from places like the Kalahari Desert or
Arctic Circle. T en thousand years ago, this was obviously not the case.
Everyone was a forager; overall population densities were low . Foragers
were therefore free to live in pretty much any sort of territory they fancied.
All things being equal, those living of f wild resources would tend to cleave
to places where they were abundant. Y ou would think this is self-evident,
but apparently it isn’ t.
Those who today describe people like the Calusa as ‘atypical’ because
they had such a prosperous resource base want us to believe, instead, that
ancient foragers chose to avoid locations of this kind, shunning the rivers
and coasts (which also of fered natural arteries for movement andcommunication), because they were so keen to oblige later researchers by
resembling twentieth-century hunter -gatherers (the sort for which detailed
scientiﬁc data is available today). W e are asked to believe that it was only
after they ran out of deserts and mountains and rainforests that they
reluctantly started to colonize richer and more comfortable environments.
We might call this the ‘all the bad spots are taken!’ ar gument.
In fact, there was nothing atypical about the Calusa. They were just one
of many ﬁsher -forager populations living around the Straits of Florida –
including the T equesta, Pojoy , Jeaga, Jobe and Ais (some apparently ruled
by dynasties of their own) – with whom Calusa conducted regular trade,
fought wars and arranged dynastic marriages. They were also among the
ﬁrst Native American societies to be destroyed since, for obvious reasons,
coasts and estuaries were the ﬁrst spots where Spanish colonizers landed,
bringing epidemic diseases, priests, tribute and, eventually , settlers. This
was a pattern repeated on every continent, from America to Oceania, where
invariably the most attractive ports, harbours, ﬁsheries and surrounding
lands were ﬁrst snapped up by British, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch
or Russian settlers, who also drained tidal salt marshes and coastal lagoons
to farm cereals and cash crops.45
Such was the fate of the Calusa and their ancient ﬁshing and hunting
grounds. When Florida was ceded to the British in the mid eighteenth
century , the last handful of surviving subjects from the kingdom of Calos
were shipped of f to the Caribbean by their Spanish masters.
For most of human history , ﬁshers, hunters and foragers did not have to
contend with expansive empires; therefore, they themselves tended to be the
most active human colonizers of aquatic environments. Archaeological
evidence increasingly bears this out. It was long thought, for instance, that
the Americas were ﬁrst settled by humans travelling mainly over land (the
so-called ‘Clovis people’). Around 13,000 years ago they were supposed to
have followed an arduous crossing from Beringia, the land bridge between
Russia and Alaska, passing south between terrestrial glaciers, over frozen
mountains – all because, for some reason, it never occurred to any of them
to build a boat and follow the coast.
More recent evidence suggests a very dif ferent picture (or , as one Navajo
informant put it when faced with an archaeological map of the terrestrialroute via Beringia: ‘maybe some other guys came over like that, but us
Navajos came a dif ferent way’).46
In fact, Eurasian populations made a much earlier entry to what was then
a genuinely ‘New W orld’, some 17,000 years ago. What was more, they did
indeed think to build boats, following a coastal route that passed around the
Paciﬁc Rim, hopping between of fshore islands and linear patches of kelp
forest and ending somewhere on the southern coast of Chile. Early eastward
crossings also took place.47 Of course, it’ s possible that these ﬁrst
Americans, on arriving in such rich coastal habitats, quickly abandoned
them, preferring for some obscure reason to spend the rest of their lives
climbing mountains, hacking their way through forests and trekking across
endless monotonous prairies. But it seems more plausible to assume that the
bulk of them stayed exactly where they were, often forming dense and
stable settlements in such locations.
The problem is, until recently this has always been an ar gument from
silence, since rising sea levels long ago submer ged the earliest records of
shoreline habitation in most parts of the world. Archaeologists have tended
to resist the conclusion that such habitations must have existed despite the
lack of physical remains; but, with advances in the investigation of
underwater environments, the case is growing stronger . A distinctly soggier
(but also frankly more commonsensical) account of early human dispersal
and settlement is ﬁnally becoming possible.48
IN WHICH WE FINALL Y RETURN T O THE QUESTION OF
PROPER TY, AND INQUIRE AS T O ITS RELA TION T O THE
SACRED
All this means that, of the many distinct cultural universes beginning to take
shape across the world in the Early Holocene, most were likely centred on
environments of abundance rather than scarcity: more like the Calusa’ s than
the !Kung’ s. Does this also mean they were likely to have similar political
arrangements to the Calusa? Here some caution is in order .
That the Calusa managed to maintain a sufﬁcient economic surplus to
support what looks to us like a miniature kingdom does not mean such an
outcome is inevitable as soon as a society is capable of stockpiling a
sufﬁcient quantity of ﬁsh. After all, the Calusa were seafaring people; they
would have undoubtedly been familiar with kingdoms ruled by divinemonarchs like the Great Sun of the Natchez in nearby Louisiana and, likely
as not, the empires of Central America. It’ s possible they were simply
imitating more powerful neighbours. Or maybe they were just odd. Finally ,
we don’ t really know how much power even a divine king like Carlos really
had. Here it’ s useful to consider the Natchez themselves: an agricultural
group, much better documented than the Calusa, and with a spectacular and
purportedly absolute monarch of their own.
The Natchez Sun, as the monarch was known, inhabited a village in
which he appeared to wield unlimited power . His every movement was
greeted by elaborate rituals of deference, bowing and scraping; he could
order arbitrary executions, help himself to any of his subjects’ possessions,
do pretty much anything he liked. Still, this power was strictly limited by
his own physical presence, which in turn was lar gely conﬁned to the royal
village itself. Most Natchez did not live in the royal village (indeed, most
tended to avoid the place, for obvious reasons); outside it, royal
representatives were treated no more seriously than Montagnais-Naskapi
chiefs. If subjects weren’ t inclined to obey these representatives’ orders,
they simply laughed at them. In other words, while the court of the Natchez
Sun was not pure empty theatre – those executed by the Great Sun were
most deﬁnitely dead – neither was it the court of Suleiman the Magniﬁcent
or Aurangzeb. It seems to have been something almost precisely in
between.
Was Calusa kingship a similar arrangement? Spanish observers clearly
didn’ t think so (they regarded it as a more or less absolute monarchy), but
since typically half the point of such deadly theatrics is to impress outsiders,
that tells us very little in itself.49
What have we learned so far?
Most obviously , that we can now put a ﬁnal nail in the cofﬁn of the
prevailing view that human beings lived more or less like Kalahari
Bushmen, until the invention of agriculture sent everything askew . Even
were it possible to write of f Pleistocene mammoth hunters as some kind of
strange anomaly , the same clearly cannot be said for the period that
immediately followed the glaciers’ retreat, when dozens of new societies
began to form along resource-rich coasts, estuaries and river valleys,
gathering in lar ge and often permanent settlements, creating entirely newindustries, building monuments according to mathematical principles,
developing regional cuisines, and so on.
We have also learned that at least some of these societies developed a
material infrastructure capable of supporting royal courts and standing
armies – even though we have, as yet, no clear evidence that they actually
did so. T o construct the earthworks at Poverty Point, for instance, must have
taken enormous amounts of human labour and a strict regime of carefully
planned-out work, but we still have little idea how that labour was
organized. Japanese archaeologists, surveying thousands of years’ worth of
Jōmon sites, have discovered all sorts of treasures, but they are yet to ﬁnd
indisputable evidence that those treasures were monopolized by any sort of
aristocracy or ruling elite.
We cannot possibly know exactly which forms of ownership existed in
these societies. What we can suggest, and there’ s plenty of evidence to
support it, is that all the places in question – Poverty Point, Sannai
Maruyama, the Kastelli Giant’ s Church in Finland, or indeed the earlier
resting places of Upper Palaeolithic grandees – were in some sense sacred
places. This might not seem like saying very much, but it’ s important: it
tells us a lot more about the ‘origins’ of private property than is generally
assumed. In rounding of f this discussion, we will try to explain why .
Let’s turn again to the anthropologist James W oodburn, and a less well-
known insight from his work on ‘immediate return’ hunter -gatherers. Even
among those forager groups, famous for their assertive egalitarianism, he
notes, there was one striking exception to the rule that no adult should ever
presume to give direct orders to another , and that individuals should not lay
private claim to property . This exception came in the sphere of ritual, of the
sacred. In Hadza religion and the religions of many Pygmy groups,
initiation into male (and sometimes female) cults forms the basis of
exclusive claims to ownership, usually of ritual privileges, that stand in
absolute contrast to the minimization of exclusive property rights in
everyday , secular life. These various forms of ritual and intellectual
property , Woodburn observed, are generally protected by secrecy , by
deception and often by the threat of violence.50
Here, W oodburn cites the sacred trumpets that initiated males of certain
Pygmy groups keep hidden in secret places in the forest. Not only are
women and children not supposed to know about such sacred treasures;should any follow the men to spy on them, they would be attacked or even
raped.51 Strikingly similar practices involving sacred trumpets, sacred
ﬂutes or other fairly obvious phallic symbols are commonplace in certain
contemporary societies of Papua New Guinea and Amazonia. V ery often
there is a complex game of secrets, whereby the instruments are
periodically taken out of their hiding places and men pretend they are the
voices of spirits, or use them as part of costumed masquerades in which
they impersonate spirits to terrify women and children.52
Now , these sacred items are, in many cases, the only important and
exclusive forms of property that exist in societies where personal autonomy
is taken to be a paramount value, or what we may simply call ‘free
societies’. It’ s not just relations of command that are strictly conﬁned to
sacred contexts, or even occasions when humans impersonate spirits; so too
is absolute – or what we would today refer to as ‘private’ – property . In
such societies, there turns out to be a profound formal similarity between
the notion of private property and the notion of the sacred. Both are,
essentially , structures of exclusion.
Much of this is implicit – if never clearly stated or developed – in Émile
Durkheim’ s classic deﬁnition of ‘the sacred’ as that which is ‘set apart’:
removed from the world, and placed on a pedestal, at some times literally
and at other times ﬁguratively , because of its imperceptible connection with
a higher force or being. Durkheim ar gued that the clearest expression of the
sacred was the Polynesian term tabu, meaning ‘not to be touched’. But
when we speak of absolute, private property , are we not talking about
something very similar – almost identical in fact, in its underlying logic and
social ef fects?
As British legal theorists like to put it, individual property rights are held,
notionally at least, ‘against the whole world’. If you own a car , you have the
right to prevent anyone in the entire world from entering or using it. (If you
think about it, this is the only right you have in your car that’ s really
absolute. Almost anything else you can do with a car is strictly regulated:
where and how you can drive it, park it, and so forth. But you can keep
absolutely anyone else in the world from getting inside it.) In this case the
object is set apart, fenced about by invisible or visible barriers – not
because it is tied to some supernatural being, but because it’ s sacred to a
speciﬁc, living human individual. In other respects, the logic is much the
same.To recognize the close parallels between private property and notions of
the sacred is also to recognize what is so historically odd about European
social thought. Which is that – quite unlike free societies – we take this
absolute, sacred quality in private property as a paradigm for all human
rights and freedoms. This is what the political scientist C. B. Macpherson
meant by ‘possessive individualism’. Just as every man’ s home is his castle,
so your right not to be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned rests on the
idea that you own your own body , just as you own your chattels and
possessions, and legally have the right to exclude others from your land, or
house, or car , and so on.53 As we’ve seen, those who did not share this
particular European conception of the sacred could indeed be killed,
tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned – and, from Amazonia to Oceania, they
often were.54
For most Native American societies, this kind of attitude was profoundly
alien. If it applied anywhere at all, then it was only with regard to sacred
objects, or what the anthropologist Robert Lowie termed ‘sacra’ when he
pointed out long ago that many of the most important forms of indigenous
property were immaterial or incorporeal: magic formulae, stories, medical
knowledge, the right to perform a certain dance, or stitch a certain pattern
on one’ s mantle. It was often the case that weapons, tools and even
territories used to hunt game were freely shared – but the esoteric powers to
safeguard the reproduction of game from one season to the next, or ensure
luck in the chase, were individually owned and jealously guarded.55
Quite often, sacra have both material and immaterial elements; as among
the Kwakiutl, where ownership of an heirloom wooden feast-dish also
conveyed the right to gather berries on a certain stretch of land with which
to ﬁll it; which in turn af forded its owner the right to present those berries
while singing a certain song at a certain feast, and so forth.56 Such forms of
sacred property are endlessly complex and variable. Among Plains societies
of North America, for instance, sacred bundles (which normally included
not only physical objects but accompanying dances, rituals and songs) were
often the only objects in that society to be treated as private property: not
just owned exclusively by individuals, but also inherited, bought and sold.57
Often, the true ‘owners’ of land or other natural resources were said to be
gods or spirits; mortal humans are merely squatters, poachers, or at best
caretakers. People variously adopted a predatory attitude to resources – aswith hunters, who appropriate what really belongs to the gods – or that of a
caretaker (where one is only the ‘owner ’ or ‘master ’ of a village, or men’ s
house, or stretch of territory if one is ultimately responsible for maintaining
and looking after it). Sometimes these attitudes coexist, as in Amazonia,
where the paradigm for ownership (or ‘mastery’ – it’ s always the same
word) involves capturing wild animals and then adopting them as pets; that
is, precisely the point where violent appropriation of the natural world turns
into nurture or ‘taking care’.58
It is not unusual for ethnographers working with indigenous Amazonian
societies to discover that almost everything around them has an owner , or
could potentially be owned, from lakes and mountains to cultivars, liana
groves and animals. As ethnographers also note, such ownership always
carries a double meaning of domination and care. T o be without an owner is
to be exposed, unprotected.59 In what anthropologists refer to as totemic
systems, of the kind we discussed for Australia and North America, the
responsibility of care takes on a particularly extreme form. Each human
clan is said to ‘own’ a certain species of animal – thus making them the
‘Bear clan’, ‘Elk clan’, ‘Eagle clan’ and so forth – but what this means is
precisely that members of that clan cannot hunt, kill, harm or otherwise
consume animals of that species. In fact, they are expected to take part in
rituals that promote its existence and make it ﬂourish.
What makes the Roman Law conception of property – the basis of almost
all legal systems today – unique is that the responsibility to care and share
is reduced to a minimum, or even eliminated entirely . In Roman Law there
are three basic rights relating to possession: usus (the right to use), fructus
(the right to enjoy the products of a property , for instance the fruit of a tree),
and abusus  (the right to damage or destroy). If one has only the ﬁrst two
rights this is referred to as usufruct , and is not considered true possession
under the law . The deﬁning feature of true legal property , then, is that one
has the option of not taking care of it, or even destroying it at will.
We are now , ﬁnally , approaching a general conclusion about the coming of
private property , which can be illustrated by one last and especially striking
example: the famous initiation rituals of the Australian W estern Desert.
Here adult males of each clan act as guardians or custodians of particular
territories. There are certain sacra, known as churinga  or tsurinja  by the
Aranda, which are relics of ancestors who ef fectively created each clan’ sterritory in ancient times. Mostly , they are smoothed pieces of wood or
stone inscribed with a totemic emblem. The same objects could also
embody legal title to those lands. Émile Durkheim considered them the very
archetype of the sacred: things set apart from the ordinary world and
accorded pious devotion; ef fectively , the ‘Holy Ark of the clan’.60
During periodic rites of initiation, new cohorts of male Aranda youths are
taught about the history of the land and the nature of its resources. They are
also char ged with the responsibility of caring for it, which in particular
means the duty to maintain churinga  and the sacred sites associated with
them, which only the initiated should properly know about in the ﬁrst place.
As observed by T . G. H. Strehlow – an anthropologist and the son of a
Lutheran missionary , who spent many years among the Aranda in the early
twentieth century , becoming the foremost non-Aranda authority on this
topic – the weight of duty is conveyed through terror , torture and
mutilation:
One or two months after the novice has submitted to circumcision,
there follows the second principal initiation rite, that of sub-incision
… The novice has now under gone all the requisite physical
operations which have been designed to make him worthy of a
man’ s estate, and he has learned to obey the commands of the old
men implicitly . His newly-found blind obedience stands in striking
contrast to the unbridled insolence and general unruliness of temper
which characterized his behaviour in the days of his childhood.
Native children are usually spoiled by their parents. Mothers gratify
every whim of their of fspring, and fathers do not bother about any
disciplinary measures. The deliberate cruelty with which the
traditional initiation rites are carried out at a later age is carefully
calculated to punish insolent and lawless boys for their past
impudence and to train them into obedient, dutiful ‘citizens’ who
will obey their elders without a murmur , and be ﬁt heirs to the
ancient sacred traditions of their clan.61
Here is another , painfully clear example of how behaviour observed in
ritual contexts takes exactly the opposite form to the free and equal
relations that prevail in ordinary life. It is only within such contexts thatexclusive (sacred) forms of property exist, strict and top-down hierarchies
are enforced, and where orders given are dutifully obeyed.62
Looking back again to prehistory , it is – as we’ve already noted –
impossible to know precisely which forms of property or ownership existed
at places like Göbekli T epe, Poverty Point, Sannai Maruyama or
Stonehenge, any more than we can know if regalia buried with the ‘princes’
of the Upper Palaeolithic were their personal possessions. What we can
now suggest, in light of these wider considerations, is that such carefully
co-ordinated ritual theatres, often laid out with geometrical precision, were
exactly the kinds of places where exclusive claims to rights over property –
together with strict demands for unquestioning obedience – were likely to
be made, among otherwise free people. If private property has an ‘origin’, it
is as old as the idea of the sacred, which is likely as old as humanity itself.
The pertinent question to ask is not so much when this happened, as how it
eventually came to order so many other aspects of human af fairs.5
Many Seasons Ago
Why Canadian foragers kept slaves and their Californian neighbours
didn’ t; or, the pr oblem with ‘modes of pr oduction’
Our world as it existed just before the dawn of agriculture was anything but
a world of roving hunter -gatherer bands. It was marked, in many places, by
sedentary villages and towns, some by then already ancient, as well as
monumental sanctuaries and stockpiled wealth, much of it the work of ritual
specialists, highly skilled artisans and architects.
When considering the broad sweep of history , most scholars either
completely ignore this pre-agricultural world or write it of f as some kind of
strange anomaly: a false start to civilization. Palaeolithic hunters and
Mesolithic ﬁsherfolk may have buried their dead like aristocracy , but the
‘origins’ of class stratiﬁcation are still sought in much later periods.
Louisiana’ s Poverty Point may have had the dimensions and at least some
functions of an ancient city , but it is absent from most histories of North
American urbanism, let alone urbanism in general; just as 10,000 years of
Japanese civilization is sometimes written of f as a prelude to the coming of
rice-farming and metallur gy. Even the Calusa of Florida Keys are often
referred to as an ‘incipient chiefdom’. What’ s deemed important is not what
they were, but the fact that they could be on the brink of turning into
something else: a ‘proper ’ kingdom, presumably , whose subjects paid
tribute in crops.
This peculiar habit of thought requires us to treat whole populations of
‘complex hunter -gatherers’ either as deviants, who took some kind of
diversion from the evolutionary highway , or as lingering on the cusp of an
‘Agricultural Revolution’ that never quite took place. It’ s bad enough when
this is applied to a people like the Calusa, who were after all relatively
small in number , living in complicated historical circumstances. Y et thesame logic is regularly applied to the history of entire indigenous
populations along the Paciﬁc Coast of North America, in a territory running
from present-day greater Los Angeles to the surroundings of V ancouver .
When Christopher Columbus set sail from Palos de la Frontera in 1492,
these lands were home to hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of
inhabitants.1 They were foragers, but about as dif ferent from the Hadza,
Mbuti or !Kung as one can imagine. Living in an unusually bounteous
environment, often occupying villages year -round, the indigenous peoples
of California, for example, were notorious for their industry and, in many
cases, near -obsession with the accumulation of wealth. Archaeologists often
characterize their techniques of land management as a kind of incipient
agriculture; some even use Aboriginal California as a model for what the
prehistoric inhabitants of the Fertile Crescent – who ﬁrst began
domesticating wheat and barley 10,000 years ago in the Middle East –
might have been like.
To be fair to the archaeologists, it’ s an obvious comparison, since
ecologically California – with its ‘Mediterranean’ climate, exceptionally
fertile soils and tight juxtaposition of micro-environments (deserts, forests,
valleys, coastlands and mountains) – is remarkably similar to the western
ﬂank of the Middle East (the area, say , from modern Gaza or Amman north
to Beirut and Damascus). On the other hand, a comparison with the
inventors of farming makes little sense from the perspective of indigenous
Californians, who could hardly have failed to notice the nearby presence –
particularly among their Southwest neighbours – of tropical crops,
including maize corn, which ﬁrst arrived there from Mesoamerica around
4,000 years ago.2 While the free peoples of North America’ s eastern
seaboard nearly all adopted at least some food crops, those of the W est
Coast uniformly rejected them. Indigenous peoples of California were not
pre-agricultural. If anything, they were anti-agricultural.
IN WHICH WE FIRST CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF
CUL TURAL DIFFERENTIA TION
The systematic nature of this rejection of agriculture is a fascinating
phenomenon in itself. Most who attempt to explain it nowadays appeal
almost entirely to environmental factors: relying on acorns or pine nuts as
one’s staple in California, or aquatic resources further north, was simplyecologically more efﬁcient than the maize agriculture adopted in other parts
of North America. No doubt this was true on the whole, but in an area
spanning several thousand miles and a wide variety of dif ferent ecosystems,
it seems unlikely that there was not a single region where maize cultivation
would have been advantageous. And if efﬁciency was the only
consideration, one would have to imagine there were some cultigens –
beans, squash, pumpkins, watermelons, any one of an endless variety of
leafy vegetables – that someone, somewhere along the coast might have
found worth adopting.
The systematic rejection of all domesticated foodstuf fs is even more
striking when one realizes that many Californians and Northwest Coast
peoples did plant and grow tobacco, as well as other plants – such as
springbank clover and Paciﬁc silverweed – which they used for ritual
purposes, or as luxuries consumed only at special feasts.3 In other words,
they were perfectly familiar with the techniques for planting and tending to
cultigens. Y et they comprehensively rejected the idea of planting everyday
foodstuf fs or treating crops as staples.
One reason this rejection is signiﬁcant is that it of fers a clue as to how
one might answer the much broader question we posed – but then left
dangling – at the beginning of Chapter Four : what is it that causes human
beings to spend so much ef fort trying to demonstrate that they are dif ferent
from their neighbours? Recall how , after the end of the last Ice Age, the
archaeological record is increasingly characterized by ‘culture areas’: that
is, localized populations with their own characteristic styles of clothing,
cooking and architecture; and no doubt also their own stories about the
origin of the universe, rules for the marriage of cousins, and so forth. Ever
since Mesolithic times, the broad tendency has been for human beings to
further subdivide, coming up with endless new ways to distinguish
themselves from their neighbours.
It is curious how little anthropologists speculate about why this whole
process of subdivision ever happened. It’ s usually treated as self-evident, an
inescapable fact of human existence. If any explanation is of fered, it’ s
assumed to be an ef fect of language. T ribes or nations are regularly referred
to as ‘ethno-linguistic’ groups; that is, what is really important about them
is the fact they share the same language. Those who share the same
language are presumed, all other things being equal, also to share the same
customs, sensibilities and traditions of family life. Languages, in turn, aregenerally assumed to branch of f from one another by something like a
natural process.
In this line of reasoning, a key breakthrough was the realization – usually
attributed to Sir W illiam Jones, a British colonial ofﬁcial stationed in
Bengal towards the end of the eighteenth century – that Greek, Latin and
Sanskrit all seem to derive from a common root. Before long, linguists had
determined that Celtic, Germanic and Slavic languages – as well as Persian,
Armenian, Kurdish and more – all belonged to the same ‘Indo-European’
family . Others, for instance Semitic, T urkic and East Asian languages, did
not. Studying relationships among these various linguistic groups
eventually led to the science of glottochronology: how distinct languages
diver ge from a common source. Since all languages are continually
changing, and since that change appears to occur at a relatively steady pace,
it became possible to reconstruct how and when T urkic languages began to
separate from Mongolic, or the relative temporal distance between Spanish
and French, Finnish and Estonian, Hawaiian and Malagasy , and so on. All
this led to the construction of a series of linguistic family trees, and
eventually an attempt – still highly controversial – to trace virtually all
Eurasian languages to a single hypothetical ancestor called ‘Nostratic’.
Nostratic was believed to have existed sometime during the later
Palaeolithic, or even to have been the original phylum from which every
human language sprang.
It might seem strange to imagine linguistic drift causing a single idiom to
evolve into languages as dif ferent as English, Chinese and Apache; but,
given the extraordinarily long periods of time being considered here, even
an accretion of tiny generational changes can, it seems, eventually
transform the vocabulary and sound-structure, even the grammar of a
language completely .
If cultural dif ferences lar gely correspond to what happens in language,
then distinct human cultures, more generally , would have to be the product
of a similar process of gradual drift. As populations migrated or became
otherwise isolated from one another , they formed not only their own
characteristic languages but their own traditional customs as well. All this
involves any number of lar gely unexamined assumptions – for instance,
why is it that languages are always changing to begin with? – but the main
point is this. Even if we take such an explanation as a given, it doesn’ t
really explain what we actually observe on the ground.Consider an ethno-linguistic map of northern California in the early
twentieth century , set into a lar ger map of North American ‘culture areas’ as
deﬁned by ethnologists at that time:
What we are presented with here is a collection of people with broadly
similar cultural practices, but speaking a jumble of languages, many drawn
from entirely dif ferent language families – as distant from one another as,
say, Arabic, T amil and Portuguese. All these groups shared broad
similarities: in terms of how they went about gathering and processing
foodstuf fs; in their most important religious rituals; in the or ganization of
their political life, and so on. But there were also subtle or not-so-subtle
differences between them, so that members of each group saw themselves
as distinct kinds of people: Y urok, Hupa, Karok and so forth.
These local identities did map on to linguistic dif ferences. However ,
neighbouring peoples speaking languages drawn from dif ferent families
(Athabascan, Na-Dene, Uto-Aztecan and so on) actually had far more in
common with each other , in almost every other way , than they did with
speakers of languages from the same linguistic family living in other parts
of North America. The same can be said of the First Nations of the
Canadian Northwest Coast, who also speak a variety of unrelated
languages, but in other ways resemble one another far more closely than
they do speakers of the same languages from outside the Northwest Coast,
including in California.
Of course, European colonization had a profound and catastrophic impact
on the distribution of Native American peoples, but what we are seeing here
also reﬂects a deeper continuity of culture-historical development, a process
that tended to occur at various points in human history , when modern nation
states were not around to order populations into neat ethno-linguistic
groups. Ar guably , the very idea that the world is divided into such
homogeneous units, each with its own history , is lar gely a product of the
modern nation state, and the desire of each to claim for itself a deep
territorial lineage. At the very least, we should think twice before projecting
such uniformities back in time, on to remote periods of human history for
which no direct evidence of language distributions even exists.In this chapter , we want to explore what actually did drive processes of
cultural subdivision for the greater part of human history . Such processes
are crucial to understanding how human freedoms, once taken for granted,
eventually came to be lost. In doing this, we’ll focus on the history of those
non-agricultural peoples who inhabited the western coast of North America.
As their refusal of agriculture implies, these processes were likely far more
self-conscious than scholars usually imagine. In some cases, as we’ll see,
they appear to have involved explicit reﬂection and ar gument about the
nature of freedom itself.
WHERE WE CONSIDER THE WILDL Y INADEQUA TE,
SOMETIMES OFFENSIVE BUT OCCASIONALL Y SUGGESTIVE
WAYS IN WHICH THE QUESTION OF ‘CUL TURE AREAS’ HAS
BEEN BROACHED BEFORE
How did earlier generations of scholars describe these regional clusters of
societies? The term most commonly used, up until the middle of the
twentieth century , was ‘culture areas’ (or ‘culture circles’), a concept which,
nowadays, has either been for gotten or fallen into disrepute.
The notion of ‘culture areas’ ﬁrst emer ged in the last decades of the
nineteenth century and the ﬁrst of the twentieth. Since the Renaissance,
human history had been seen lar gely as the story of great migrations:
humans, having fallen from grace, wandering ever more distant from the
Garden of Eden. Family trees showing the dispersal of Indo-European or
Semitic languages did nothing to discourage this kind of thinking. But the
notion of human progress pulled in the exact opposite direction: it
encouraged researchers to imagine ‘primitive’ peoples as tiny , isolated
communities, cut of f from each other and the larger world. This, of course,
is what made it possible to treat them as specimens of earlier stages of
human development in the ﬁrst place: if everyone were in regular contact
with each other , this sort of evolutionist analysis wouldn’ t really work.4
The notion of ‘culture areas’, by contrast, came lar gely out of museums,
and particularly in North America. Curators or ganizing art and artefacts hadto decide whether to arrange their material so as to illustrate theories about
the dif ferent stages of human adaptation (Lower Savagery , Upper Savagery ,
Lower Barbarism and so on); or so as to trace the history of ancient
migrations, whether real or imagined (in the American context this would
mean or ganizing them by language family , then assumed, for no particularly
good reason, to correspond with ‘racial’ stocks); or whether to simply
organize them into regional clusters.5 Though the last of these seemed
most arbitrary , it proved to be the one that really worked best. Art and
technology from dif ferent Eastern W oodlands tribes, for instance, appeared
to have much more in common than material from, say , all speakers of
Athabascan languages; or all people who relied mainly on ﬁshing, or
cultivated maize. This method turned out to work quite well for
archaeological material too, with prehistorians like the Australian V .
Gordon Childe observing similar patterns among Neolithic villages
stretching across central Europe, forming regional clusters of evidence
relating to domestic life, art and ritual.
At ﬁrst, the most prominent exponent of the culture area approach was
Franz Boas. Boas, it will be recalled, was a transplanted German
ethnologist6 who in 1899 landed a chair in anthropology at New Y ork’s
Columbia University . He also gained a position in char ge of ethnographic
collections at the American Museum of Natural History , where his halls
dedicated to the Eastern W oodlands and Northwest Coast still remain
popular attractions over a century later . Boas’ s student and successor at the
museum, Clark W issler , tried to systematize his ideas by dividing the
Americas as a whole, from Newfoundland to T ierra del Fuego, into ﬁfteen
different regional systems, each with its own characteristic customs,
aesthetic styles, ways of obtaining and preparing food, and forms of social
organization. Before long, other ethnologists were undertaking similar
projects, mapping out regions from Europe to Oceania.
Boas was a staunch anti-racist. As a German Jew , he was particularly
troubled by the way the American obsession with race and eugenics was
being taken up in his own mother country .7 When W issler began to
embrace certain eugenicist ideas, the pair had a bitter falling-out. But the
original impetus for the culture area concept was precisely to ﬁnd a way of
talking about human history which avoided ranking populations into higher
or lower on any grounds, whether claiming some were of superior genetic
stock or had reached a more advanced level of moral and technologicalevolution. Instead, Boas and his students proposed that anthropologists
reconstruct the dif fusion of what were then referred to as ‘culture traits’
(ceramics, sweat lodges, the or ganization of young men into competing
warrior societies), and try to understand why , as W issler put it, tribes of a
certain region came to share ‘the same mesh of culture traits’.8
This resulted in a peculiar fascination with reconstructing the historical
movement, or ‘dif fusion’, of speciﬁc customs and ideas. Flipping through
anthropological journals from the turn of the twentieth century , you ﬁnd
that the majority of the essays in a given number are of this type. They paid
special attention to contemporary games and musical instruments used, say ,
in various dif ferent parts of Africa, or of Oceania – perhaps because, of all
culture traits, these seemed least af fected by practical considerations or
constraints, and their distribution might therefore shed light on historical
patterns of contact and inﬂuence. One especially lively area of debate
concerned the string-ﬁgure game known as cat’ s cradles. During the T orres
Straits expedition of 1898, Professors Alfred Haddon and W . H. R. Rivers,
then leading ﬁgures in British anthropology , developed a uniform method of
diagramming string ﬁgures used in children’ s play , which made it possible
for systematic comparisons to be made. Before long, rival theories
concerning the origins and dif fusion of particular patterns of string ﬁgures
(the Palm T ree, the Bagobo Diamond …) among dif ferent societies were
being hotly contested in the pages of the Journal of the Royal
Anthr opological Society  and similar erudite venues.9
The obvious questions, then, were: why culture traits cluster as they do;
and how they come to be ‘enmeshed’ in regional patterns to begin with.
Boas himself was convinced that while geography might have deﬁned the
circulation of ideas within particular regions (mountains and deserts
forming natural barriers), what happened inside those regions was,
effectively , down to historical accident. Others hypothesized about the
predominating ethos or form of or ganization within a given region; or
dreamed of creating a kind of natural science that might one day explain or
even predict the ebb and ﬂow of styles, habits and social forms. Almost no
one reads this literature any more. Like the cat’ s cradles, today it’ s
considered at best an amusing token of the discipline’ s childhood.
Still, important issues were raised here: issues which no one to this day
has really been able to address. For example, why are the peoples of
California so similar to one another , and so dif ferent from neighbouringpeoples of the American Southwest, or the Canadian Northwest Coast?
Perhaps the most insightful contribution came from Marcel Mauss, who
tackled the notion of ‘culture areas’ in a series of essays on nationalism and
civilization written between 1910 and 1930.10 Mauss thought the idea of
cultural ‘dif fusion’ was mostly nonsense; not for the reasons most
anthropologists do now (that it’ s pointless and uninteresting),1 1 but because
he felt it was based on a false assumption: that the movement of people,
technologies and ideas was somehow unusual.
The exact opposite was true, Mauss ar gued. People in past times, he
wrote, appear to have travelled a great deal – more than they do today – and
it’s simply impossible to imagine that anyone back then would have been
unaware of the existence of basketry , feather pillows, or the wheel if such
objects were regularly employed a month or two’ s journey away; the same
could presumably be said of ancestor cults or syncopated drum rhythms.
Mauss went further . He was convinced the entire Paciﬁc Rim had once been
a single realm of cultural exchange, with voyagers criss-crossing it at
regular intervals. He too was interested in the distribution of games across
the entire region. Once, he taught a college course called ‘On the greasy
pole, the ball play , and other games on the periphery of the Paciﬁc Ocean’,
his premise being that, at least when it came to games, all lands bordering
the Paciﬁc – from Japan to New Zealand to California – could be treated,
effectively , as a single culture area.12 Legend has it that when Mauss,
visiting New Y ork’s American Museum of Natural History , was shown the
famous Kwakiutl war canoe in Boas’ s Northwest Coast wing, his ﬁrst
reaction was to say that now he knew precisely what ancient China must
have looked like.
Though Mauss overstated his case, his exaggeration nonetheless led him
to reframe the entire question of ‘culture areas’ in an intriguing way .13 For
if everyone was broadly aware of what surrounding people were up to, and
if knowledge of foreign customs, arts and technologies was widespread, or
at least easily available, then the question becomes not why certain culture
traits spread, but why other culture traits didn’ t. The answer , Mauss felt, is
that this is precisely how cultures deﬁne themselves against their
neighbours. Cultures were, ef fectively , structures of refusal. Chinese are
people who use chopsticks, but not knives and forks; Thai are people who
use spoons, but not chopsticks, and so forth. It’ s easy enough to see how
this could be true of aesthetics – styles of art, music or table manners – butsurprisingly , Mauss found, it extended even to technologies which held
obvious adaptive or utilitarian beneﬁts. He was intrigued, for example, by
the fact that Athabascans in Alaska steadfastly refused to adopt Inuit
kayaks, despite these being self-evidently more suited to the environment
than their own boats. Inuit, for their part, refused to adopt Athabascan
snowshoes.
What was true of particular cultures was equally true of culture areas; or ,
as Mauss preferred, ‘civilizations’. Since almost any existing style, form or
technique has always been potentially available to almost anyone, these too
must always have come about through some such combination of
borrowing and refusal. Crucially , Mauss noted, this process tends to be
quite self-conscious. He especially liked to evoke the example of debates in
Chinese courts about the adoption of foreign styles and customs, such as the
remarkable ar gument put forward by a king of the Zhou Dynasty to his
advisors and great feudal vassals, who were refusing to wear the Hunnish
(Manchu) dress and to ride horses instead of driving chariots: he
painstakingly tried to show them the dif ference between rites and customs,
between the arts and fashion. ‘Societies’, wrote Mauss, ‘live by borrowing
from each other , but they deﬁne themselves rather by the refusal of
borrowing than by its acceptance.’14
Nor are such reﬂections limited to what historians think of as ‘high’ (that
is, literate) civilizations. Inuit did not simply react with instinctual revulsion
when they ﬁrst encountered someone wearing snowshoes, and then refused
to change their minds. They reﬂected on what adopting, or not adopting,
snowshoes might say about the kind of people they considered themselves
to be. In fact, Mauss concluded, it is precisely in comparing themselves
with their neighbours that people come to think of themselves as distinct
groups.
Framed in this way , the question of how ‘culture areas’ formed is
necessarily a political one. It raises the possibility that decisions such as
whether or not to adopt agriculture weren’ t just calculations of caloric
advantage or matters of random cultural taste, but also reﬂected questions
about values, about what humans really are (and consider themselves to be),
and how they should properly relate to one another . Just the kinds of issues,
in fact, which our own post-Enlightenment intellectual tradition tends to
express through terms like freedom, responsibility , authority , equality ,
solidarity and justice.IN WHICH WE APPL Y MAUSS’S INSIGHT T O THE P ACIFIC
COAST AND CONSIDER WHY W ALTER GOLDSCHMIDT’S
DESCRIPTION OF ABORIGINAL CALIFORNIANS AS
‘PROTEST ANT FORAGERS’, WHILE IN MANY W AYS ABSURD,
STILL HAS SOMETHING T O TELL US
Let us return, then, to the Paciﬁc. Since around the start of the twentieth
century , anthropologists have divided the indigenous inhabitants of North
America’ s western littoral into two broad culture areas: ‘California’ and the
‘Northwest Coast’. Before the nineteenth century , when the ef fects of the
fur trade and then the Gold Rush wreaked havoc on indigenous groups and
many were exterminated, these populations formed a continuous chain of
foraging societies extending through much of the W est Coast: at that time,
perhaps the lar gest continuous distribution of foraging peoples in the world.
If nothing else, it was a highly efﬁcient way of life; both the Northwest
Coast peoples and those of California maintained higher densities of
population than, say , maize, beans and squash farmers of the nearby Great
Basin and American Southwest.
In other ways, the northern and southern zones were profoundly dif ferent,
both ecologically and culturally . The peoples of the Canadian Northwest
Coast relied heavily on ﬁshing, and particularly the harvesting of
anadromous ﬁsh such as salmon and eulachon, which migrate upriver from
the sea to spawn; as well as a variety of marine mammals, terrestrial plants
and game resources. As we saw a couple of chapters ago, these groups
divided their year between very lar ge coastal winter villages, holding
ceremonies of great complexity , and, in spring and summer , smaller social
units that were more pragmatically focused on the provision of food. Expert
woodworkers, they also transformed the local conifers (ﬁr , spruce, redwood,
yew and cedar) into a dazzling material culture of carved and painted
masks, containers, tribal crests, totem poles, richly decorated houses and
canoes which ranks among the world’ s most striking artistic traditions.
Aboriginal societies in California, to the south, occupied one of the
world’ s most diverse habitats. They made use of a staggering variety of
terrestrial resources, which they managed by careful techniques of burning,
clearing and pruning. The region’ s ‘Mediterranean’ climate and tightly
compressed topography of mountains, deserts, foothills, river valleys and
coastlines made for a rich assortment of local ﬂora and fauna, exchanged atinter-tribal trade fairs. Most Californians were proﬁcient ﬁshers and
hunters, but many also followed an ancient reliance on tree crops –
especially nuts and acorns – as staple foods. Their artistic traditions dif fered
from those of the Northwest Coast. House exteriors were generally plain
and simple. There was almost nothing similar to the Northwest Coast masks
or monumental sculptures that so delight museum curators; rather , aesthetic
activity focused on the weaving of highly patterned baskets used for storing
and serving food.15
There was a further important dif ference between these two extensive
groupings of societies, one that for some reason is far less remarked on by
scholars today . From the Klamath River northwards, there existed societies
dominated by warrior aristocracies engaged in frequent inter -group raiding
and in which, traditionally , a signiﬁcant portion of the population had
consisted of chattel slaves. This apparently had been true as long as anyone
living there could remember . But none of this was the case further south.
How exactly did this happen? How did a boundary emer ge between one
extended ‘family’ of foraging societies that habitually raided each other for
slaves, and another that did not keep slaves at all?
You might think there would be a lively debate about this among
scholars, but in fact there isn’ t. Instead, most treat the dif ferences as
insigniﬁcant, preferring to lump all Californian and Northwest Coast
societies together in a single category of ‘afﬂuent foragers’ or ‘complex
hunter -gatherers’.16 If dif ferences between them are considered at all, they
are usually understood as mechanical responses to their contrasting modes
of subsistence: aquatic (ﬁsh-based) economies, it’ s argued, simply tended to
foster warlike societies, just as terrestrial (acorn-based) foraging economies
somehow did not.17 We will shortly consider the merits and limitations of
such recent ar guments, but ﬁrst it is useful to turn back to some of the
ethnographic work undertaken by earlier generations.
Some of the most striking research about the indigenous peoples of
California was done by the twentieth-century anthropologist W alter
Goldschmidt. One of his key writings, unobtrusively entitled ‘an
ethnological contribution to the sociology of knowledge’, was concerned
with the Y urok and other related groups who inhabited the northwestern
corner of California, just south of the mountain ranges where Oregon
begins.18 For Goldschmidt and members of his anthropological circle, the
Yurok were famous for the central role that money – which took the form ofwhite dentalium shells arranged on strings, and headbands made of bright
red woodpecker scalps – played in every aspect of their social lives.
It’s worth mentioning here that settlers in dif ferent parts of North
America referred to a whole variety of things as ‘Indian money’. Often
these were shell beads or actual shells. But in almost every case, the term is
largely a projection of European categories on to objects that look like
money , but really aren’ t. Probably the most famous of these, wampum , did
eventually come to be used as a trade currency in transactions between
settlers and indigenous peoples of the Northeast, and was even accepted as
currency in several American states for transactions between settlers (in
Massachusetts and New Y ork, for instance, wampum  was legal tender in
shops). In dealings between indigenous people, however , it was almost
never used to buy or sell anything. Rather , it was employed to pay ﬁnes,
and as a way of forming and remembering compacts and agreements. This
was true in California as well. But in California, unusually , money also
seems to have been used in more or less the way we expect money to have
been used: for purchases, rentals and loans. In California in general, and its
northwest corner in particular , the central role of money in indigenous
societies was combined with a cultural emphasis on thrift and simplicity , a
disapproval of wasteful pleasures, and a gloriﬁcation of work that –
according to Goldschmidt – bore an uncanny resemblance to the Puritan
attitudes described by Max W eber in his famous 1905 essay , The Pr otestant
Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.
This analogy might seem a bit of a stretch, and in many ways it was. But
it’s important to understand the comparison that Goldschmidt was actually
making. W eber’s essay , familiar to just about anyone who’ s ever taken a
social science course, is often misunderstood. W eber was trying to answer a
very speciﬁc question: why capitalism emer ged in western Europe, and not
elsewhere. Capitalism, as he deﬁned it, was itself a kind of moral
imperative. Almost everywhere in the world, he noted, and certainly in
China, India and the Islamic world, one found commerce, wealthy
merchants and people who might justly be referred to as ‘capitalists’. But
almost everywhere, anyone who acquired an enormous fortune would
eventually cash in their chips. They would either buy themselves a palace
and enjoy life, or come under enormous moral pressure from their
community to spend their proﬁts on religious or public works, or boozy
popular festivities (usually they did a bit of both).Capitalism, on the other hand, involved constant reinvestment, turning
one’s wealth into an engine for creating ever more wealth, increasing
production, expanding operations, and so forth. But imagine, W eber
suggested, being the very ﬁrst person in one’ s community to act this way .
To do so would have meant defying all social expectations, to be utterly
despised by almost all your neighbours – who would, increasingly , also
become your employees. Anyone capable of acting in such a deﬁantly
single-minded manner , Weber observed, would ‘have to be some sort of
hero’. This, he said, is the reason why it took a Puritanical strain of
Christianity , like Calvinism, to make capitalism possible. Puritans not only
believed almost anything they could spend their proﬁts on was sinful; but
also, joining a Puritan congregation meant one had a moral community
whose support would allow one to endure the hostility of one’ s hell-bound
neighbours.
Obviously , none of this was true in an eighteenth-century Y urok village.
Aboriginal Californians did not hire one another as wage labourers, lend
money at interest, or invest the proﬁts of commercial ventures to expand
production. There were no ‘capitalists’ in the literal sense. What there was,
however , was a remarkable cultural emphasis on private property . As
Goldschmidt notes, all property , whether natural resources, money or items
of wealth, was ‘privately (and for the most part individually) owned’,
including ﬁshing, hunting and gathering grounds. Individual ownership was
complete, with full rights of alienation. Such a highly developed concept of
property , Goldschmidt observed, requires the use of money , such that in
Northwest California ‘money buys everything – wealth, resources, food,
honor and wives.’19
This very unusual property regime corresponded to a broad ethos, which
Goldschmidt compared to W eber’s ‘spirit’ of capitalism (though, one might
object, it corresponds more to how capitalists like to imagine the world than
to how capitalism actually works). The Y urok were what we’ve called
‘possessive individualists’. They took it for granted that we are all born
equal, and that it is up to each of us to make something of ourselves through
self-discipline, self-denial and hard work. What’ s more, this ethos appears
to have been lar gely applied in practice.
As we’ve seen, the indigenous peoples of the Northwest Coast were just
as industrious as those of California, and in both cases those who
accumulated wealth were expected to give much of it away by sponsoringcollective festivals. The underlying ethos, however , could not have been
more dif ferent. Where the wealthy Y urok were expected to be modest,
Kwakiutl chiefs were boastful and vainglorious; so much so that one
anthropologist compared them to paranoid schizophrenics. Where wealthy
Yurok made little of their ancestry , Northwest Coast households had much
in common with the noble houses and dynastic estates of medieval Europe,
in which a class of nobles jockeyed for position within ranks of hereditary
privilege, staging dazzling banquets to enhance their reputations and secure
their claims to honoriﬁc titles and heirloom treasures stretching back to the
beginning of time.20
It’s hard to imagine that the existence of such striking cultural dif ferences
between neighbouring populations could be completely coincidental, but
it’s also extremely difﬁcult to ﬁnd any studies that even begin to address the
question of how this contrast came about.21 Is it possible to see indigenous
Californians and peoples of the Northwest Coast as deﬁning themselves
against each other , rather in the manner that Californians and New Y orkers
do today? If so, then how much of their way of life can we really explain as
being motivated by a desire to be unlike other groups of people? Here, we
need to bring back our earlier discussion of schismogenesis, which we
introduced to help make sense of the intellectual encounter between
seventeenth-century French colonists and the W endat people of North
America’ s Eastern W oodlands.
Schismogenesis, you’ll recall, describes how societies in contact with
each other end up joined within a common system of dif ferences, even as
they attempt to distinguish themselves from one another . Perhaps the classic
historical example (in both senses of the term ‘classic’) would be the
ancient Greek city-states of Athens and Sparta, in the ﬁfth century BC. As
Marshall Sahlins puts it:
Dynamically interconnected, they were then reciprocally constituted
… Athens was to Sparta as sea to land, cosmopolitan to xenophobic,
commercial to autarkic, luxurious to frugal, democratic to
oligarchic, urban to villageois, autochthonous to immigrant,
logomanic to laconic: one cannot ﬁnish enumerating the
dichotomies … Athens and Sparta were antitypes.22Each society performs a mirror image of the other . In doing so, it becomes
an indispensable alter ego, the necessary and ever -present example of what
one should never wish to be. Might a similar logic apply to the history of
foraging societies in California and on the Northwest Coast?
WHERE WE MAKE A CASE FOR SCHISMOGENESIS BETWEEN
‘PROTEST ANT FORAGERS’ AND ‘FISHER KINGS’
Let’s look more closely at what might be described, in W eber’s sense, as the
‘spirit’ of northern Californian foragers. At root, it was a series of ethical
imperatives, in Goldschmidt’ s words: ‘the moral demand to work and by
extension pursuit of gain; the moral demand of self-denial; and the
individuation of moral responsibility’.23 Bound up in this was a passion for
individual autonomy as absolute as that of any Kalahari Bushman – even if
it took a strikingly dif ferent form. Y urok men scrupulously avoided being
placed in a situation of debt or ongoing obligation to anyone else. Even the
collective management of resources was frowned upon; foraging grounds
were individually owned and could be rented out in times of shortfall.
Property was sacred, and not only in the legal sense that poachers could
be shot. It also had a spiritual value. Y urok men would often spend long
hours meditating on money , while the highest objects of wealth – precious
hides and obsidian blades displayed only at festivals – were the ultimate
sacra. Y urok struck outsiders as puritanical in a literal sense as well: as
Goldschmidt reports, ambitious Y urok men were ‘exhorted to abstain from
any kind of indulgence – eating, sexual gratiﬁcation, play or sloth’. Big
eaters were considered ‘vulgar ’. Young men and women were lectured on
the need to eat slowly and modestly , to keep their bodies slim and lithe.
Wealthy Y urok men would gather every day in sweat lodges, where an
almost daily test of these ascetic values was the need to crawl headﬁrst
through a tiny aperture that no overweight body could possibly enter .
Repasts were kept bland and spartan, decoration simple, dancing modest
and restrained. There were no inherited ranks or titles. Even those who did
inherit wealth continued to emphasize their personal hard work, frugality
and achievement; and while the rich were expected to be generous towards
the less fortunate and look after their own lands and possessions,
responsibilities for sharing and caring were modest in comparison with
foraging societies almost anywhere else.Northwest Coast societies, in contrast, became notorious among outside
observers for the delight they took in displays of excess. They were best
known to European ethnologists for the festivals called potlatch , usually
held by aristocrats acceding to some new noble title (nobles would often
accumulate many of these over the course of a lifetime). In these feasts they
sought to display their grandeur and contempt for ordinary worldly
possessions by performing magniﬁcent feats of generosity , overwhelming
their rivals with gallons of candleﬁsh oil, berries and quantities of fatty and
greasy ﬁsh. Such feasts were scenes of dramatic contests, sometimes
culminating in the ostentatious destruction of heirloom copper shields and
other treasures, just as in the early period of colonial contact, around the
turn of the nineteenth century , they sometimes culminated in the sacriﬁcial
killing of slaves. Each treasure was unique; there was nothing that
resembled money . Potlatch  was an occasion for gluttony and indulgence,
‘grease feasts’ designed to leave the body shiny and fat. Nobles often
compared themselves to mountains, with the gifts they bestowed rolling of f
them like boulders, to ﬂatten and crush their rivals.
The Northwest Coast group we know best are the Kwakwaka’wakw
(Kwakiutl), among whom Boas conducted ﬁeldwork. They became famous
for the exuberant ornamentation of their art – their love of masks within
masks – and the theatrical stage ef fects employed in their rituals, including
fake blood, trap doors and violent clown-police. All the surrounding
societies – including the Nootka, Haida and T simshian – appear to have
shared the same broad ethos: similarly dazzling material cultures and
performances could be found all the way from Alaska south to the area of
Washington State. They also shared the same basic social structure, with
hereditary ranks of nobles, commoners and slaves. Throughout this entire
region, a 1,500-mile strip of land from the Copper River delta to Cape
Mendocino, inter -group raiding for slaves was endemic, and had been for as
long as anyone could recall.
In all these societies of the Northwest Coast, nobles alone enjoyed the
ritual prerogative to engage with guardian spirits, who conferred access to
aristocratic titles, and the right to keep the slaves captured in raids.
Commoners, including brilliant artists and craftspeople, were lar gely free to
decide which noble house they wished to align themselves with; chiefs vied
for their allegiance by sponsoring feasts, entertainment and vicarious
participation in their heroic adventures. ‘T ake good care of your people,’went the elder ’s advice to a young Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) chief. ‘If your
people don’ t like you, you’re nothing.’24
In many ways, the behaviour of Northwest Coast aristocrats resembles
that of Maﬁa dons, with their strict codes of honour and patronage relations;
or what sociologists speak of as ‘court societies’ – the sort of arrangement
one might expect in, say , feudal Sicily , from which the Maﬁa derived many
of its cultural codes.25 But this is emphatically not what we are taught to
expect among foragers. Granted, the followers of any one of these ‘ﬁsher -
kings’ rarely numbered more than 100 or 200 people, not much lar ger than
the size of a Californian village; in neither the Northwest Coast nor the
Californian culture area were there overarching political, economic or
religious or ganizations of any kind. But within the tiny communities that
did exist, entirely dif ferent principles of social life applied.
All this begins to make the anthropologists’ habit of lumping Y urok
notables and Kwakiutl artists together as ‘afﬂuent foragers’ or ‘complex
hunter -gatherers’ seem rather silly: the equivalent of saying a T exas oil
executive and a medieval Egyptian poet were both ‘complex
agriculturalists’ because they ate a lot of wheat.
But how do we explain the dif ferences between these two culture areas?
Do we start from the institutional structure (the rank system and importance
of potlatch  in the Northwest Coast, the role of money and private property
in California), then try to understand how the prevailing ethos of each
society emer ges from it? Or did the ethos come ﬁrst – a certain conception
of the nature of humanity and its role in the cosmos – and did the
institutional structures emer ge from that? Or are both simply ef fects of a
different technological adaptation to the environment?
These are fundamental questions about the nature of society . Theorists
have been batting them about for centuries, and probably will be for
centuries to come. T o put the matter more technically , we might ask what
ultimately determines the shape a society takes: economic factors,
organizational imperatives or cultural meanings and ideas? Following in the
footsteps of Mauss, we might also suggest a fourth possibility . Are societies
in effect self-determining, building and reproducing themselves primarily
with reference to each other?
There’ s a lot riding on the answer we give in this particular case. The
indigenous history of the Paciﬁc Coast might not provide a very goodmodel for what the ﬁrst ‘proto-farmers’ in the Fertile Crescent were like,
10,000 years ago. But it does shed unique light on other kinds of cultural
processes, which – as we explored above – have been going on for just as
long, if not longer: whereby certain foraging peoples, in particular times
and places, came to accept permanent inequalities, structures of domination
and the loss of freedoms.
Let’s now go through the possible explanations, one by one.
The most striking dif ference between the indigenous societies of California
and the Northwest Coast is the absence, in California, of formal ranks and
the institution of potlatch . The second really follows from the ﬁrst. In
California there were feasts and festivals, to be sure, but since there was no
title system, these lacked almost all the distinctive features of potlatch : the
division between ‘high’ and ‘low’ forms of cuisine, the use of ranked
seating orders and serving equipment, obligatory eating of oily foods,
competitive gifting, self-aggrandizing speeches, or any other public
manifestations of rivalry between nobles ﬁghting over titular privilege.26
In many ways, the seasonal gatherings of Californian tribes seem exactly
to reverse the principles of potlatch.  Staple rather than luxury foods were
consumed; ritual dances were playful rather than regimented or menacing,
often involving the humorous transgression of social boundaries between
men and women, children and elders (they seem to be one of the few
occasions when the otherwise staid Y urok allowed themselves to have a bit
of fun). V aluables such as obsidian blades and deer skins were never
sacriﬁced or gifted to enemies as a challenge or insult, but carefully
unwrapped and passed into the trust of temporary ‘dance leaders’, as if to
underline how much their owners wished to avoid drawing undue attention
to themselves.27
Local headmen in California certainly did beneﬁt by hosting such
occasions: social connections were made, and an enhanced reputation could
often mean later opportunities to make money .28 But insofar as feast
sponsors could be seen as self-aggrandizing, they themselves went to great
lengths to downplay their roles, and anyway , attributing a secret desire for
proﬁt to them seems reductive in the extreme, even rather insulting,
considering the actual redistribution of resources that went on in
Californian trade feasts and ‘deerskin dances’, and their well-documentedimportance in promoting solidarity between groups from neighbouring
hamlets.29
So are we talking about the same basic institution (a ‘redistributive
feast’) carried out in an entirely dif ferent spirit, or two entirely dif ferent
institutions, or even, potlatch  and anti- potlatch ? How are we to tell? Clearly
the issue is much broader , and touches on the very nature of ‘culture areas’
and what actually constitutes a threshold or boundary between them. W e are
looking for a key to this problem. It lies in the institution of slavery , which,
as we’ve noted, was endemic on the Northwest Coast but correspondingly
absent south of the Klamath River in California.
Slaves on the Northwest Coast were hewers of wood and drawers of
water , but they were especially involved in the mass harvesting, cleaning
and processing of salmon and other anadromous ﬁsh. There’ s no consensus,
however , on how far back the indigenous practice of slavery actually went
there. The ﬁrst European accounts of the region in the late eighteenth
century speak of slaves, and express mild surprise in doing so, since full-
ﬂedged chattel slavery was quite unusual in other parts of aboriginal North
America. These accounts suggest that perhaps a quarter of the indigenous
Northwest Coast population lived in bondage – which is about equivalent to
proportions found in the Roman Empire, or classical Athens, or indeed the
cotton plantations of the American South. What’ s more, slavery on the
Northwest Coast was a hereditary status: if you were a slave, your children
were also fated to be so.30
Given the limitations of our sources, it’ s always possible that these
European accounts were describing what was, at the time, a recent
innovation. Current archaeological and ethno-historical research, though,
suggests that the institution of slavery goes back a very long way indeed on
the Northwest Coast, many centuries before European ships began docking
at Nootka Sound to trade in otter pelts and blankets.
CONCERNING THE NA TURE OF SLA VER Y AND ‘MODES OF
PRODUCTION’ MORE GENERALL Y
It’s ﬁendishly difﬁcult to ‘ﬁnd slavery’ in the archaeological record,
unaided by written records; but on the W est Coast we can at least observe
how many of the elements that later came together in the institution of
slavery emer ged at roughly the same time, starting around 1850 BC, inwhat’ s called the Middle Paciﬁc period. This is when we ﬁrst observe the
bulk harvesting of anadromous ﬁsh, an incredibly bounteous resource –
later travellers recounted salmon runs so massive one could not see the
water for the ﬁsh – but one that involved a dramatic intensiﬁcation of labour
demands. It’ s presumably no coincidence that around this same time, we see
also the ﬁrst signs of warfare and the building of defensive fortiﬁcations,
and expanding trade networks.31 There are also some other pointers.
Cemeteries of Middle Paciﬁc age, between 1850 BC and AD 200, reveal
extreme disparities in treatments of the dead, something not seen in earlier
times. At the ‘top end’, the most privileged burials exhibit formal systems
of body ornamentation, and the somewhat macabre staging of corpses in
seated, reclining or other ﬁxed positions, presumably referencing a strict
hierarchy of ritual postures and manners among the living. At the ‘bottom’
we see quite the other extreme: mutilation of certain individuals’ bodies,
recycling of human bone to make tools and containers, and the ‘of fering’ of
people as grave goods (i.e. human sacriﬁce). The overall impression is of a
wide spectrum of formalized statuses, ranging from high rank to people
whose lives and deaths appear to have mattered little.32
Turning now to California, one thing we can note straight away is the
absence of all these features in correspondingly early periods. South of
Cape Mendocino we seem to be dealing with a dif ferent kind of Middle
Paciﬁc – a more ‘paciﬁc’ one, in fact. But we can’ t put these dif ferences
down to a lack of contact between the two groups. On the contrary ,
archaeological and linguistic evidence demonstrates extensive movement of
people and goods along much of the W est Coast. A vibrant, canoe-borne
maritime commerce already linked coastal and island societies, conveying
valuables such as shell beads, copper , obsidian and a host of or ganic
commodities across the diverse ecologies of the Paciﬁc littoral. V arious
lines of evidence also point to the movement of human captives as a feature
of inter -group warfare and trade. As early as 1500 BC, some parts of the
shoreline around the Salish Sea were already equipped with fortiﬁcations
and shelters, in apparent anticipation of raids.33
So far , we have been talking about slavery without really deﬁning the term.
This is a little unwise, because Amerindian slavery had certain speciﬁc
features that make it very dif ferent from ancient Greek or Roman household
slavery , let alone European plantation slavery in the Caribbean or inAmerica’ s Deep South. While slavery of any sort was a fairly unusual
institution among indigenous peoples of the Americas, some of these
distinctively Amerindian features were shared, at least in their broad
outlines, across much of the continent, including the tropics, where the
earliest Spanish sources document local forms of slavery back to the
ﬁfteenth century AD. The Brazilian anthropologist Fernando Santos-Granero
has coined a term for Amerindian societies that possessed these features. He
calls them ‘capturing societies’.34
Before exploring what he means, let’ s deﬁne slavery itself. What makes a
slave dif ferent from a serf, a peon, captive or inmate is their lack of social
ties. In legal terms, at least, a slave has no family , no kin, no community;
they can make no promises and for ge no ongoing connections with other
human beings. This is why the English word ‘free’ is actually derived from
a root meaning ‘friend’. Slaves could not have friends because they could
not make commitments to others, since they were entirely under someone
else’s power and their only obligation was to do exactly what their master
said. If a Roman legionary was captured in battle and enslaved, then
managed to escape and return home, he had to go through an elaborate
process of restoring all his social relationships, including remarrying his
wife, since the act of enslaving him was considered to have severed all
previous relationships. The W est Indian sociologist Orlando Patterson has
referred to this as a condition of ‘social death’.35
Unsurprisingly , the archetypical slaves are usually war captives, who are
typically far from home amid people who owe them nothing. There is
another practical reason for turning war captives into slaves. A slave’ s
master has a responsibility to keep them alive in a ﬁt state to work. Most
human beings need a good deal of care and resources, and can usually be
considered a net economic loss until they are twelve or sometimes ﬁfteen
years old. It rarely makes economic sense to breed slaves – which is why ,
globally , slaves have so often been the product of military aggression
(though many were also products of debt traps, punitive judicial decisions
or banditry). Seen one way , a slave-raider is stealing the years of caring
labour another society invested to create a work-capable human being.36
What, then, do Amerindian ‘capturing societies’ have in common which
makes them distinctive from other kinds of slave-holding societies? On the
face of it, not much. And least of all their modes of subsistence, which were
about as diverse as could be imagined. As Santos-Granero points out, inNorthwest Amazonia the dominant peoples were sedentary horticulturalists
and ﬁshermen living along the lar gest rivers, who raided the nomadic
hunting-gathering bands of the hinterland. By contrast, in the Paraguay
River basin it was semi-itinerant hunter -gatherers who raided or subjugated
village agriculturalists. In southern Florida the hegemonic groups (Calusa,
in this case) were ﬁshermen-gatherers who lived in lar ge, permanent
villages but moved seasonally to ﬁshing and gathering sites, raiding both
ﬁshing and farming communities.37
Classifying these groups according to how much they farmed, ﬁshed or
hunted tells us little of their actual histories. What really mattered, in terms
of the ebb and ﬂow of power and resources, was their use of or ganized
violence to ‘feed of f’ other populations. Sometimes the foraging peoples –
such as the Guaicurú of the Paraguay palm savannah, or the Calusa of
Florida Keys – had the upper hand militarily over their agricultural
neighbours. In such cases, taking slaves and exacting tribute exempted a
portion of the dominant society from basic subsistence chores, and
supported the existence of leisured elites. It also supported the training of
specialized warrior castes, which in turn created the means for further
appropriation and further tribute.
Here, again, the idea of classifying human societies by ‘modes of
subsistence’ looks decidedly naive. How , for instance, would we propose to
classify foragers who consume quantities of domestic  crops, exacted as
tribute from nearby farming populations? Marxists, who refer to ‘modes of
production’, do sometimes allow for a ‘T ributary Mode,’ but this has
always been linked to the growth of agrarian states and empires, back to
Book III of Marx’ s Capital .38 What really needs to be theorized here is not
just the mode of production practised by victims  of predation, but also that
of the non-producers who prey on them. Now wait. A non-productive mode
of production? This sounds like a contradiction in terms. But it’ s only so if
we limit the meaning of ‘production’ strictly to the creation of food or
goods. And maybe we shouldn’ t.
‘Capturing societies’ in the Americas considered slave-taking as a mode
of subsistence in its own right, but not in the usual sense of producing
calories. Raiders almost invariably insisted that slaves were captured for
their life force or ‘vitality’ – vitality which was consumed by the
conquering group.39 Now , you might say this is literally true: if you exploit
another human being for their labour , either directly or indirectly , you areliving of f their ener gies or life force; and if they are providing you with
food, you are in fact eating it. But there is slightly more going on here.
Let’s recall Amazonian ideas of ownership. Y ou appropriate something
from nature, killing or uprooting it, but then this initial act of violence is
transformed into a relation of caring, as you maintain and tend what is
captured. Slave-raiding was talked about in similar terms, as hunting
(traditionally men’ s work), and captives were likened to vanquished prey .
Experiencing social death, they would come to be regarded as something
more like ‘pets’. While being re-socialized in their captors’ households they
had to be nurtured, cooked for , fed and instructed in the proper ways of
civilization; in short, domesticated (these tasks were usually women’ s
work). If the socialization was completed, the captive ceased to be a slave.
However , captives could sometimes be kept suspended in social death, as
part of a permanent pool of victims awaiting their actual, physical death.
Typically they would be killed at collective feasts (akin to the Northwest
Coast potlatch ) presided over by ritual specialists, and this would
sometimes result in the eating of enemy ﬂesh.40
All this may seem exotic. However , it echoes the way exploited people
everywhere and throughout history tend to feel about their situation: their
bosses, or landlords, or superiors are blood-sucking vampires, and they are
treated at best as pets and at worst as cattle. It’ s just that in the Americas, a
handful of societies enacted those relationships in a quite literal fashion.
The more important point, concerning ‘modes of production’ or ‘modes of
subsistence’, is that this kind of exploitation often took the form of ongoing
relations between  societies. Slavery almost always tends to do this, since
imposing ‘social death’ on people whose biological relatives speak the
same language as you and can easily travel to where you live will always
create problems.
Let’s recall how some of the ﬁrst European travellers to the Americas
compared ‘savage’ males to noblemen back home – because, like these
noblemen, they dedicated almost all their time to politics, hunting, raiding
and waging war on neighbouring groups. A German observer in 1548 spoke
of Arawakan villagers of the Grand Chaco in Paraguay as serfs of Guaicurú
foragers, ‘in the same way as German rustics are with respect to their lords’.
The implication was that little really separates a Guaicurú warrior from a
Swabian feudal baron, who likely spoke French at home, feasted regularly
on wild game and lived of f the labour of German-speaking peasants, eventhough he had never touched a plough. At what point, we might then ask,
were the Guaicurú, who lived amid piles of maize, manioc (cassava) and
other agricultural products delivered as tribute, as well as slaves secured in
raids on societies even further distant, no longer simply ‘hunter -gatherers’
(especially if they were also hunting and gathering other humans)?
True, crops were sent as tribute from nearby conquered villages, but
tributary villages also sent servants, and raids on villages further out tended
to concentrate on enslaving women, who could serve as concubines,
nursemaids and domestics – allowing Guaicurú ‘princesses’, their bodies
often completely covered with intricate tattoos and spiral designs painted on
daily by their domestics, to devote their days to leisure. Early Spanish
commentators always remarked that Guaicurú treated their slaves with care
and even tenderness, almost exactly as they did their pet parrots and
dogs,41 but what was really going on here? If slavery is the theft of labour
that other societies invest in bringing up children, and the main purpose to
which slaves were put was caring for children, or attending to and grooming
a leisure class, then, paradoxically , the main objective of slave-taking for
the ‘capturing society’ seems to have been to increase its internal capacity
for caring labour . What was ultimately being produced here, within
Guaicurú society , were certain kinds of people: nobles, princesses, warriors,
commoners, servants, and so on.42
What needs emphasizing – since it will become extremely important as
our story unfolds – is the profound ambivalence, or perhaps we might better
say double-edged-ness, of these caring relationships. Amerindian societies
typically referred to themselves by some term that can be roughly translated
as ‘human beings’ – most of the tribal names traditionally applied to them
by Europeans are derogatory terms used by their neighbours (‘Eskimo’, for
example, means ‘people who don’ t cook their ﬁsh’, and ‘Iroquois’ is
derived from an Algonkian term meaning ‘vicious killers’). Almost all these
societies took pride in their ability to adopt children or captives – even from
among those whom they considered the most benighted of their neighbours
– and, through care and education, turn them into what they considered to
be proper human beings. Slaves, it follows, were an anomaly: people who
were neither killed nor adopted, but who hovered somewhere in between;
abruptly and violently suspended in the midpoint of a process that should
normally lead from prey to pet to family . As such, the captive as slave
becomes trapped in the role of ‘caring for others’, a non-person whose workis lar gely directed towards enabling those others to become persons,
warriors, princesses, ‘human beings’ of a particularly valued and special
kind.
As these examples show , if we want to understand the origins of violent
domination in human societies, this is precisely where we need to look.
Mere acts of violence are passing; acts of violence transformed into caring
relations have a tendency to endure. Now that we have a clearer idea of
what Amerindian slavery actually involved, let us return to the Paciﬁc
Coast of North America and try to understand some of the speciﬁc
conditions that made chattel slavery so prevalent on the Northwest Coast,
and so unusual in California. W e’ll start with a piece of oral history , an old
story .
IN WHICH WE CONSIDER ‘THE ST ORY OF THE WOGIES’ – AN
INDIGENOUS CAUTIONAR Y TALE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF
TRYING T O GET RICH QUICK BY ENSLA VING OTHERS (AND
INDULGE OURSEL VES IN AN ASIDE ON ‘GUNS, GERMS AND
STEEL ’)
The story we’re about to recount is ﬁrst attested in 1873 by the geographer
A. W . Chase. Chase claims it was related to him by people of the Chetco
Nation of Oregon. It concerns the origins of the word ‘W ogie’ (pronounced
‘Wâgeh’), which across much of the coastal region was an indigenous term
for white settlers. The story didn’ t really register among scholars; it was
repeated a couple of times in the following half-century or so, but otherwise
that was it. Y et this long-overlooked story contains some precious gems of
information, especially about indigenous attitudes to slavery , at precisely
the interface between California and the Northwest Coast that we’ve been
exploring.
Barely a handful of Chetco exist today . Originally dominating the
southern shoreline of Oregon, they were lar gely wiped out in genocidal
massacres carried out by invading settlers in the mid nineteenth century . By
the 1870s, a small number of survivors were living in the Siletz
Reservation, now in Lincoln County . This is what their ancestors told Chase
about their origins and where they had come from:The Chetkos say that, many seasons ago, their ancestors came in
canoes from the far north, and landed at the river ’s mouth. They
found two tribes in possession, one a warlike race, resembling
themselves; these they soon conquered and exterminated. The other
was a diminutive people, of an exceedingly mild disposition, and
white. These called themselves, or were called by the new-comers,
‘Wogies.’ They were skillful in the manufacture of baskets, robes,
and canoes, and had many methods of taking game and ﬁsh which
were unknown to the invaders. Refusing to ﬁght, the W ogies were
made slaves of, and kept at work to provide food and shelter and
articles of use for the more warlike race, who waxed very fat and
lazy. One night, however , after a grand feast, the W ogies packed up
and ﬂed, and were never more seen. When the ﬁrst white men
appeared, the Chetkos supposed that they were the W ogies returned.
They soon found out their mistake, however , but retained among
themselves the appellation for the white men, who are known as
Wogies by all the coast tribes in the vicinity .43
The tale might seem unassuming, but there’ s a lot packed into it. That the
survivors of a forager group on the Oregon coast should narrate Euro-
American colonization as an act of historical vengeance is unsurprising.44
Neither is there anything implausible about an indigenous slave-holding
society migrating south by sea into new territory , at some remote time, and
either subjugating or killing the autochthonous inhabitants.45
Similarly to the Guaicurú, the aggressors appear to have made a point of
subduing people with skills they themselves lacked. What the ‘proto-
Chetco’ acquired was not just physical brawn (‘W ogie labour ’) or even
care, but the accumulated savoir -faire of a hunter -ﬁsher -forager people not
entirely unlike themselves and, according to the story at least, in many
respects more capable.
Another intriguing feature of this story is its setting. The Chetco lived in
the intermediate zone between our two major culture regions, precisely
where one would imagine the institution of slavery to be most explicitly
debated and contested. And indeed, the story has a distinctly ethical ﬂavour ,
as if it were a cautionary tale aimed at anyone tempted to render others
slaves, or acquire wealth and leisure through raiding. Having forced their
victims into servitude, growing ‘fat and lazy’ on the proceeds, it’ s theChetcos’ newfound sloth that makes them unable to pursue the ﬂeeing
Wogies. The W ogies come out of the whole af fair on top by virtue of their
paciﬁsm, industriousness, craft skills and capacity for innovation; indeed,
they get to make a lethal return – in spirit, at least – as Euro-American
settlers equipped with ‘guns, germs, and steel’.46
Taking this into account, the tale of the W ogies points to some intriguing
possibilities. Most importantly , it indicates that the rejection of slavery
among groups in the region between California and the Northwest Coast
had strong ethical and political dimensions. And indeed, once one starts
looking, it’ s not hard to ﬁnd further evidence for this. The Y urok, for
example, did hold a small number of slaves, mainly debt peons or captives
not yet ransomed by their relatives. But their legends evince a strong
disapproval. T o take one example, a heroic protagonist makes his fame by
defeating a maritime adventurer named Le’mekwelolmei, who would
pillage and enslave passing travellers. After defeating him in combat, our
hero rejects his appeal to join forces:
‘No, I do not want to be like you, summoning boats to the shore,
seizing them and their car go, and making people slaves. As long as
you live you will never be tyrannous again, but like other men.’
‘I will do so,’ said Le’mekwelolmei.
‘If you return to your former ways, I will kill you. Perhaps I
should take you for a slave now , but I will not. Stay in your home
and keep what is yours and leave people alone.’ T o the slaves who
stood about nearly ﬁlling the river bank, he said, ‘Go to your homes.
You are free now .’
The people who had been enslaved surrounded him, weeping and
thanking him and wanting to drag his boat back to the water . ‘No, I
will drag it myself,’ he said, and then with one hand he lifted it to
the river . So the freed people all scattered, some down-river and
some upriver to their homes.47
Northwest Coast-style maritime raiding was in no sense celebrated, to say
the least.
Still, one might ask: might there not be a more straightforward
explanation for the prevalence of slavery on the Northwest Coast, and its
absence further south? It’ s easy to express moral disapproval of a practice ifthere’ s not much economic incentive to practise it anyway . An ecological
determinist would almost necessarily ar gue this, and in fact there is a body
of literature that makes just such an ar gument for the Paciﬁc Coast – and it’ s
about the only literature that does actually take on the question of why
different coastal societies looked so dif ferent in the ﬁrst place. This is a
branch of behavioural ecology called ‘optimal foraging theory’. Its
proponents make some interesting points. Before proceeding, then, let us
consider them.
IN WHICH WE ASK: WOULD YOU RA THER FISH, OR GA THER
ACORNS?
Optimal foraging theory is a style of predictive modelling that originates in
the study of non-human species such as starlings, honeybees or ﬁsh.
Applied to humans, it typically frames behaviour in terms of economic
rationality , i.e.: ‘foragers will design their hunting and collecting strategies
with the intention of obtaining a maximum return in calories, for a
minimum outlay of labour .’ This is what behavioural ecologists call a ‘cost-
beneﬁt’ calculation. First you ﬁgure out how foragers ought to act, if they
are trying to be as efﬁcient as possible. Then you examine how they do in
fact act. If it doesn’ t correspond to the optimum foraging strategy ,
something else must be going on.
From this perspective, the behaviour of indigenous Californians was far
from optimal. As we’ve noted, they relied primarily on gathering acorns
and pine nuts as staples. In a region as bounteous as California, there’ s no
obvious reason to do this. Acorns and pine nuts of fer tiny individual food
packages and require a great deal of labour to process. T o render them
edible, most varieties require the back-breaking work of leaching and
grinding to be carried out, to remove toxins and release nutrients. Nut yields
can vary dramatically from one season to the next, a risky pattern of boom
and bust. At the same time, ﬁsh are found in abundance from the Paciﬁc
Coast inland at least as far as the conﬂuence of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin Rivers. Fish are both more nutritious and more reliable than nuts.
Despite this, salmon and other aquatic foods generally came second to tree
crops in Californian diets, and this seems to have been the case long before
the arrival of Europeans.48In terms of ‘optimal foraging theory’, then, the behaviour of Californians
simply makes no sense. Salmon can be harvested and processed in great
quantities on an annual basis, and they provide oil and fats as well as
protein. In terms of cost-beneﬁt calculations, the peoples of the Northwest
Coast are eminently more sensible than Californians, and have been for
hundreds or even thousands of years.49 Granted, they also had little choice,
since nut-gathering was never a serious option on the Northwest Coast (the
main forest species there are conifers). It’ s also true that Northwest Coast
peoples enjoyed a greater range of ﬁsh than Californians, including
eulachon (candleﬁsh), intensively exploited for its oil, which was both a
staple food and a core ingredient in ‘grease feasts,’ where nobles ladled
great quantities of this stuf f on to the burning hearth, and occasionally on to
one another . But the Californians did have a choice.
California, then, is an ecological puzzle. Most of its indigenous
inhabitants appear to have prided themselves on their hard work, clear -
sighted practicality and prudence in monetary af fairs – quite unlike the wild
and excessive self-image of Northwest Coast chiefs, who liked to boast that
they ‘didn’ t care about anything’ – but as it turns out, the Californians were
the ones basing their entire regional economy on apparently irrational
choices. Why did they choose to intensify the use of oak groves and pinion
stands when so many rich ﬁsheries were available?
Ecological determinists sometimes try to solve the puzzle by appealing to
food security . Brigands like Le’mekwelolmei might have been seen as
villains, at least in some quarters, but brigands, they ar gue, will always
exist. And what is more attractive to thieves and raiders than stockpiles of
already processed, easy-to-transport food? But dead ﬁsh, for reasons that
should be obvious to all of us, cannot be left lying around. They must be
either eaten immediately or cleaned, ﬁlleted, dried and smoked to prevent
infestation. On the Northwest Coast these tasks were completed like
clockwork in the spring and summer , because they were critical for the
group’ s physical survival, and also its social survival in the competitive
feasting exploits of the winter season.50
In the technical language of behavioural ecology , ﬁsh are ‘front-loaded’.
You have to do most of the work of preparation right away . As a result, one
could ar gue that a decision to rely heavily on ﬁsh – while undoubtedly
sensible in purely nutritional terms – is also weaving a noose for one’ s own
neck. It meant investing in the creation of a storable surplus of processedand packaged foods (not just preserved meat, but also fats and oils), which
also meant creating an irresistible temptation for plunderers.51 Acorns and
nuts, on the other hand, present neither such risks nor such temptations.
They are ‘back-loaded’. Harvesting them was a simple and fairly leisurely
affair,52 and, crucially , there was no need for processing prior to storage.
Instead most of the hard work took place only just before consumption:
leaching and grinding to make porridges, cakes and biscuits. (This is the
very opposite of smoked ﬁsh, which you don’ t even have to cook if you
don’t want to.)
So there was little point in raiding a store of raw acorns. As a result, there
was also no real incentive to develop or ganized ways of defending these
stores against potential raiders. One can begin to see the logic here.
Salmon-ﬁshing and acorn-gathering simply have very dif ferent practical
affordances, which over the long term might be expected to produce very
different sorts of societies: one warlike and prone to raiding (and after you
have made of f with the food, it’ s not much of a leap to begin carrying of f
prisoners as well), the other essentially peaceful.53 Northwest Coast
societies, then, were warlike because they simply didn’ t have the option of
relying on a war -proof staple food.
It’s certainly an elegant theory , quite clever and satisfying in its own
way.54 The problem is it just doesn’ t seem to match up to historical reality .
The ﬁrst and most obvious difﬁculty is that the capture of dried ﬁsh, or
foodstuf fs of any kind, was never a signiﬁcant aim of Northwest Coast
inter-group raiding. T o put it bluntly , there’ s only so many smoked ﬁsh one
can pile up in a war canoe. And carrying bulk products overland was even
more difﬁcult: pack animals being entirely absent in this part of the
Americas, everything had to be carried by human beings, and on a long trip
a slave is likely to eat about as much as they can carry . The main aim of
raids was always to capture people, never food.55 But this was also one of
the most densely populated regions of North America. Where, then, did this
hunger for people come from? These are precisely the kind of questions that
‘optimal foraging theory’ and other ‘rational-choice’ approaches seem
utterly unable to answer .
In fact, the ultimate causes of slavery didn’ t lie in environmental or
demographic conditions, but in Northwest Coast concepts of the proper
ordering of society; and these, in turn, were the result of political jockeying
by dif ferent sectors of the population who, as everywhere, had somewhatdifferent perspectives on what a proper society should be. The simple
reality is that there was no shortage of working hands in Northwest Coast
households. But a good proportion of those hands belonged to aristocratic
title holders who felt strongly that they should be exempted from menial
work. They might hunt manatees or killer whales, but it was inconceivable
for them to be seen building weirs or gutting ﬁsh. First-hand accounts show
this often became an issue in the spring and summer , when the only limits
on ﬁsh-harvesting were the number of hands available to process and
preserve the catch. Rules of decorum prevented nobles from joining in,
while low-ranking commoners (‘perpetual transients’, as one ethnographer
called them)56 would instantly defect to a rival household if pressed too
hard or called upon too often.
In other words, aristocrats probably did feel that commoners should be
working like slaves for them, but commoners had other opinions. Many
were happy to devote long hours to art, but considered ﬁsh runs quite
another matter . Indeed, the relation between title-holding nobles and their
dependants seems to have been under constant negotiation. Sometimes it
was not entirely clear who was serving whom:
High rank was a birthright but a noble could not rest on his laurels.
He had to ‘keep up’ his name through generous feasting,
potlatching, and general open-handedness. Otherwise he ran the risk
not only of losing face but in extreme cases actually losing his
position, or even his life. Swadesh tells of a despotic [Nootka] chief
who was murdered for ‘robbing’ his commoners by demanding all
of his ﬁshermen’ s catch, rather than the usual tributary portion. His
successor outdid himself in generosity , saying when he caught a
whale, ‘Y ou people cut it up and everyone take one chunk; just leave
the little dorsal ﬁn for me.’57
The result, from the nobles’ point of view , was a perennial shortage, not of
labour as such but of contr ollable  labour at key times of year . This was the
problem to which slavery addressed itself. And such were the immediate
causes, which made ‘harvesting people’ from neighbouring clans no less
essential to the aboriginal economy of the Northwest Coast than
constructing weirs, clam gardens or terraced root plots.58So we must conclude that ecology does not explain the presence of
slavery on the Northwest Coast. Freedom does. T itle-holding aristocrats,
locked in rivalry with one another , simply lacked the means to compel their
own subjects to support their endless games of magniﬁcence. They were
forced to look abroad.
What, then, of California?
Picking up where we left of f, with the ‘tale of the W ogies’, a logical
place to start is precisely the boundary zone between these two culture
areas. As it turns out, the Y urok and other ‘Protestant foragers’ of northern
California were, even by Californian standards, unusual, and it behoves us
to understand why .
IN WHICH WE TURN T O THE CUL TIVATION OF DIFFERENCE
IN THE P ACIFIC ‘SHA TTER ZONE’
Alfred Kroeber , who pioneered the ethnographic study of California’ s
indigenous population, described its northwest section as a ‘shatter zone’,
an area of unusual diversity , bridging the two great culture areas of the
Paciﬁc littoral. Here the distribution of ethnic and language groups – Y urok,
Karuk, Hupa, T olowa, and as many as a dozen even smaller societies –
compressed like the bellows of an accordion. Some of these micro-nations
spoke languages of the Athabascan family; others, in their domestic
arrangements and architecture, retained traces of aristocracy that point
clearly to their origins somewhere up on the Northwest Coast. Still, with
very few exceptions, none practised chattel slavery .59
To underscore the contrast, we should note that in any true Northwest
Coast settlement hereditary slaves might have constituted up to a quarter of
the population. These ﬁgures are striking. As we noted earlier , they rival the
demographic balance in the colonial South at the height of the cotton boom
and are in line with estimates for household slavery in classical Athens.60
If so, these were full-blown ‘slave societies’ where unfree labour
underpinned the domestic economy and sustained the prosperity of nobles
and commoners alike. Assuming that many groups came south from the
Northwest Coast, as linguistic and other evidence suggests, and that at least
some of this movement took place after about 1800 BC (when slavery was
most likely institutionalized), the question becomes: when and how did
foragers in the ‘shatter zone’ come to lose the habit of keeping slaves?The ‘when’ part of this question is really a matter for future research. The
‘how’ part is more accessible. In many of these societies one can observe
customs that seem explicitly designed to head of f the danger of captive
status becoming permanent. Consider , for example, the Y urok requirement
for victors in battle to pay compensation for each life taken, at the same rate
one would pay if one were guilty of murder . This seems a highly efﬁcient
way of making inter -group raiding both ﬁscally pointless and morally
bankrupt. In monetary terms, military advantage became a liability to the
winning side. As Kroeber put it, ‘The vae victis  of civilization might well
have been replaced among the Y urok, in a monetary sense at least, by the
dictum: “W oe to the victors.”’61
The Chetcos’ cautionary tale of the W ogies of fers some further pointers.
It suggests that populations directly adjacent to the Californian ‘shatter
zone’ were aware of their northern neighbours and saw them as warlike,
and as disposed to a life of luxury based on exploiting the labour of those
they subdued. It implies they recognized such exploitation as a possibility
in their own societies yet rejected it, since keeping slaves would undermine
important social values (they would become ‘fat and lazy’). T urning south,
to the California shatter zone itself, we ﬁnd evidence that, in many key
areas of social life, the foragers of this region were indeed building their
communities, in good schismogenetic fashion, as a kind of mirror image; a
conscious inversion of those on the Northwest Coast. Some examples are in
order .
Clues emer ge from the simplest and most apparently pragmatic details.
Let us cite just one or two. No free member of a Northwest Coast household
would ever be seen chopping or carrying wood.62 To do so was to
undermine one’ s own status, ef fectively making oneself the equivalent of a
slave. Californian chiefs, by contrast, seem to have elevated these exact
same activities into a solemn public duty , incorporating them into the core
rituals of the sweat lodge. As Goldschmidt observed:
All men, particularly the youths, were exhorted to gather wood for
use in sweating. This was not exploitation of child labor , but an
important religious act, freighted with signiﬁcance. Special wood
was brought from the mountain ridges; it was used for an important
puriﬁcation ritual. The gathering itself was a religious act, for it was
a means of acquiring ‘luck.’ It had to be done with the properpsychological attitude of which restrained demeanor and constant
thinking about the acquisition of riches were the chief elements. The
job became a moral end rather than a means to an end, with both
religious and economic involvements.63
Similarly , the ritual sweating that ensued – by pur ging the Californian
male’ s body of surplus ﬂuid – inverts the excessive consumption of fat,
blubber and grease that signiﬁed masculine status on the Northwest Coast.
To enhance his status and impress his ancestors, the nobleman of the
Northwest Coast ladled candleﬁsh oil into the ﬁre at the tournament ﬁelds
of the potlatch ; the Californian chief, by contrast, burned calories in the
closed seclusion of his sweat lodge.
Native Californians seem to have been well aware of the kinds of values
they were rejecting. They even institutionalized them in the ﬁgure of the
clown,64 whose public antics of sloth, gluttony and megalomania – while
offering a platform from which to sound of f about local problems and
discontents – also seem to parody the most coveted values of a proximate
civilization. Further inversions occur in the domains of spiritual and
aesthetic life. Artistic traditions of the Northwest Coast are all about
spectacle and deception: the theatrical trickery of masks that ﬂicker open
and shut, of surface ﬁgures pulling the gaze in sharply opposed directions.
The native word for ‘ritual’ in most Northwest Coast languages actually
translates as ‘fraud’ or ‘illusion’.65 Californian spirituality provides an
almost perfect antithesis. What mattered was cultivation of the inner  self
through discipline, earnest training, and hard work. Californian art entirely
avoids the use of masks.
Moreover , Californian songs and poetry show that disciplined training
and work were ways of connecting with what is authentic in life. So, while
Northwest Coast groups were not averse to adopting Europeans in lavish
naming ceremonies, would-be Californians – like Robert Frank, adopted by
the Y urok in the late nineteenth century – were more likely to ﬁnd
themselves hauling wood from the mountains, weeping with each footfall,
as they earned their place among the ‘real people’.66
If we accept that what we call ‘society’ refers to the mutual creation of
human beings, and that ‘value’ refers to the most conscious aspects of that
process, then it really is hard to see the Northwest Coast and California as
anything but opposites. People in both regions engaged in extravagantexpenditures of labour , but the forms and functions of that labour could not
have dif fered more. In the Northwest Coast, the exuberant multiplication of
furniture, crests, poles, masks, mantles and boxes was consistent with the
extravagance and theatricality of potlatch.  The ultimate purpose of all this
work and ritual creativity , however , was to ‘fasten on’ names and titles to
aristocratic contenders – to fashion speciﬁc sorts of persons. The result,
among other things, is that Northwest Coast artistic traditions are still
widely considered among the most dazzling the world has ever seen;
immediately recognizable for their strong focus on the theme of exteriority
– a world of masks, illusions and façades.67
Societies in the Californian shatter zone were equally extravagant in their
own way . But if they were ‘ potlatch ing’ anything, then surely it was labour
itself. As one ethnographer wrote of another Y urok neighbour , the
Atsugewi: ‘The ideal individual was both wealthy and industrious. In the
ﬁrst grey haze of dawn he arose to begin his day’ s work, never ceasing
activity until late at night. Early rising and the ability to go without sleep
were great virtues. It was extremely complimentary to say “he doesn’ t know
how to sleep.”’68 Wealthy men – and it should be noted that all these
societies were decidedly patriarchal – were typically seen as providers for
poorer dependants, improvident folk and foolish drifters, by virtue of their
own self-discipline and labour and that of their wives.
With its ‘Protestant’ emphasis on interiority and introspection,
Californian spirituality of fers a perfect counterpoint to the smoke and
mirrors of Northwest Coast ceremonials. Among the Y urok, work properly
performed became a way of connecting with a true reality , of which prized
objects like dentalia  and hummingbird scalps were mere outward
manifestations. A contemporary ethnographer explains:
As he ‘accumulates’ himself and becomes cleaner , the person in
training sees himself as more and more ‘real’ and thus the world as
more and more ‘beautiful’: a real place in experience rather than
merely a setting for a ‘story ,’ for intellectual knowledge … In 1865,
Captain Spott, for instance, trained for many weeks as he helped the
medicine man prepare for the First Salmon ceremony at the mouth
of the Klamath River … ‘the old [medicine] man sent him to bring
down sweathouse wood. On the way he cried with nearly every step
because now he was seeing with his own eyes how it was done.’ …Tears, crying, are of crucial importance in Y urok spiritual training as
manifestations of personal yearning, sincerity , humility , and
openness.69
Through such exertions one discovered one’ s true vocation and purpose;
and when ‘someone else’ s purpose in life is to interfere with you,’ the same
ethnographer was told, ‘he must be stopped, lest you become his slave, his
“pet”.’
The Y urok, with their puritanical manners and extraordinary cultural
emphasis on work and money , might seem an odd choice to celebrate as
anti-slavery heroes (though many Calvinist Abolitionists were not so very
different). But of course we’re not introducing them as heroes, any more
than we wish to represent their Northwest Coast neighbours as the villains
of the piece. W e are introducing them as a way to illustrate how the process
by which cultures deﬁne themselves against one another is always, at root,
political, since it involves self-conscious ar guments about the proper way to
live. Revealingly , the ar guments appear to have been most intense precisely
in this border zone between anthropological ‘culture areas’.
As we mentioned, the Y urok and their immediate neighbours were
somewhat unusual, even by Californian standards. Y et they are unusual in
contradictory ways. On the one hand, they actually did hold slaves, if few in
number . Almost all the peoples of central and southern California, the
Maidu, W intu, Pomo and so on, rejected the institution entirely .70 There
appear to have been at least two reasons for this. First, almost everywhere
except in the northwest, a man or woman’ s money and other wealth was
ritually burned at death – and as a result, the institution served as an
effective levelling mechanism.71 The Y urok-Karuk-Hupa area was one of
the few places where dentalium could actually be inherited. Combine this
with the fact that quarrels did lead to war much more frequently here than
anywhere else, and you have a kind of shrunken, diminished version of the
Northwest Coast ranking system, in this case a tripartite division between
wealthy families, ordinary Y urok and paupers.72
Captives were not slaves, all sources insist they were redeemed quickly ,
and all killers had to pay compensation; but all this required money . This
meant the important men who often instigated wars could proﬁt
handsomely from the af fair by lending to those unable to pay , and the latterwere thus either reduced to debt peons, or retreated to live ignominiously in
isolated homesteads in the woods.73 One might see the intense focus on
obtaining money , and resultant puritanism, and also the strong moral
opposition to slave-raiding as a result of tensions created by living in this
unstable and chaotic buf fer zone between the two regions. Elsewhere in
California, formal chiefs or headmen existed, and though they wielded no
power of compulsion they settled conﬂicts by raising funds for
compensation collectively , and the focus of cultural life was less on the
accumulation of property than on or ganizing annual rites of world renewal.
Here one might say things have turned full circle. The ostensible purpose
of the potlatch  and spectacular competitions over wealth and heirloom titles
on the Northwest Coast was, ultimately , to win prized roles in the great
midwinter masquerades that were, similarly , intended to revive the forces of
nature. California chiefs too were ultimately concerned with winter
masquerades – being Californians, they did not employ literal masks, but,
as in the Kwakiutl midwinter ceremonial, gods came down to earth and
were embodied in costumed dancers – designed to regenerate the world and
save it from imminent destruction. The dif ference, of course, was that in the
absence of a servile labour force or any system of hereditary titles,
Californian Pomo or Maidu chiefs had to go about or ganizing such rituals in
an entirely dif ferent way .
SOME CONCLUSIONS
Environmental determinists have an unfortunate tendency to treat humans
as little more than automata, living out some economist’ s fantasy of rational
calculation. T o be fair , they don’ t deny that human beings are quirky and
imaginative creatures – they just seem to reason that, in the long run, this
fact makes very little dif ference. Those who don’ t follow an optimal
pathway for the use of resources are destined for the ash heap of history .
Anthropologists who object to this kind of determinism will typically
appeal to culture, but ultimately this comes down to little more than
insisting that explanation is impossible: English people act the way they do
because they are English, Y urok act the way they do because they’re Y urok;
why they are English or Y urok is not really ours to say . Humans – from this
other perspective, which is just as extreme in its own way – are at best an
arbitrary constellation of cultural elements, perhaps assembled according tosome prevailing spirit, code or ethos, and which society ends up with which
ethos is treated as beyond explanation, little more than a random roll of the
dice.
Putting matters in such stark terms does not mean there is no truth to
either position. The intersection of environment and technology does make
a difference, often a huge dif ference, and to some degree, cultural
difference really is just an arbitrary roll of the dice: there’ s no ‘explanation’
for why Chinese is a tonal language and Finnish an agglutinative one; that’ s
just the way things happened to turn out. Still, if one treats the arbitrariness
of linguistic dif ference as the foundation of all social theory – which is
basically what structuralism did, and post-structuralism continues to do –
the result is just as mechanically deterministic as the most extreme form of
environmental determination. ‘Language speaks us.’ W e are doomed to
endlessly enact patterns of behaviour not of our own creation; not of
anyone’ s creation really , until some seismic shift in the cultural equivalent
of tectonic plates lands us somehow in a new , equally inexplicable
arrangement.
In other words, both approaches presume that we are already , effectively ,
stuck. This is why we ourselves place so much emphasis on the notion of
self-determination. Just as it is reasonable to assume that Pleistocene
mammoth hunters, moving back and forth between dif ferent seasonal forms
of or ganization, must have developed a degree of political self-
consciousness – to have thought about the relative merits of dif ferent ways
of living with one another – so too the intricate webs of cultural dif ference
that came to characterize human societies after the end of the last Ice Age
must surely have involved a degree of political introspection. Once again,
our intention is simply to treat those who created these forms of culture as
intelligent adults, capable of reﬂecting on the social worlds they were
building or rejecting.
Obviously , this approach, like any other , can be taken to ridiculous
extremes. Returning momentarily to W eber’s Protestant Ethic , it is popular
in certain circles to claim that ‘nations make choices’, that some have
chosen to be Protestant and others Catholic, and that this is the main reason
so many people in the United States or Germany are rich, and so many in
Brazil or Italy are poor . This makes about as much sense as ar guing that
since everyone is free to make their own decisions, the fact that some
people end up as ﬁnancial consultants and others as security guards isentirely their own doing (indeed, it’ s usually the same sort of people who
make both sorts of ar gument). Perhaps Marx put it best: we make our own
history , but not under conditions of our own choosing.
In fact, one reason social theorists will always be debating this issue is
that we can’ t really know how much dif ference ‘human agency’ – the
preferred term, currently , for what used to be called ‘free will’ – really
makes. Historical events by deﬁnition happen only once, and there’ s no real
way to know if they ‘might’ have turned out otherwise (might Spain have
never conquered Mexico? Could the steam engine have been invented in
Ptolemaic Egypt, leading to an ancient industrial revolution?), or what the
point of asking is even supposed to be. It seems part of the human condition
that while we cannot predict future events, as soon as those events do
happen we ﬁnd it hard to see them as anything but inevitable. There’ s no
way to know . So precisely where one wishes to set the dial between
freedom and determinism is lar gely a matter of taste.
Since this book is mainly about freedom, it seems appropriate to set the
dial a bit further to the left than usual, and to explore the possibility that
human beings have more collective say over their own destiny than we
ordinarily assume. Rather than deﬁning the indigenous inhabitants of the
Paciﬁc Coast of North America as ‘incipient’ farmers or as examples of
‘emer ging’ complexity – which is really just an updated way of saying they
were all ‘rushing headlong for their chains’ – we have explored the
possibility that they might have been proceeding with (more or less) open
eyes, and found plenty of evidence to support it.
Slavery , we’ve ar gued, became commonplace on the Northwest Coast
largely because an ambitious aristocracy found itself unable to reduce its
free subjects to a dependable workforce. The ensuing violence seems to
have spread until those in what we’ve been calling the ‘shatter zone’ of
northern California gradually found themselves obliged to create
institutions capable of insulating them from it, or at least its worst extremes.
A schismogenetic process ensued, whereby coastal peoples came to deﬁne
themselves increasingly against each other . This was by no means just an
argument about slavery; it appears to have af fected everything from the
conﬁguration of households, law , ritual and art to conceptions of what it
meant to be an admirable human being, and was most evident in contrasting
attitudes to work, food and material wealth.74All this played a crucial role in shaping what outsiders came to see as the
predominant sensibility of each resulting ‘culture area’ – the ﬂamboyant
extravagance of one, the austere simplicity of the other . But it also resulted
in the overwhelming rejection of the practice of slavery , and the class
system it entailed, throughout every part of California except for its
northwesternmost corner; and even there it remained sharply limited.
What does this tell us about the emer gence of similar forms of
domination in earlier phases of human history? Nothing for certain, of
course. It is difﬁcult to know for sure whether Mesolithic societies of the
Baltic or Breton coast that remind us, superﬁcially , of indigenous societies
on the Northwest Coast of Canada were, in fact, or ganized on similar
principles. ‘Complexity’ – as reﬂected in the co-ordination of labour or
elaborate ritual systems – need not mean domination. But it seems likely
that similar arrangements were, indeed, emer ging in some parts of the
world, in some times and places, and that when they did they did not go
uncontested. Regional processes of cultural dif ferentiation, of the kind one
begins to see more evidence for after the end of the last Ice Age, were
probably every bit as political as those of later ages, including the ones we
have considered in this chapter .
Second, we can now see more clearly that domination begins at home.
The fact that these arrangements became subjects of political contestation
does not mean they were political in origin. Slavery ﬁnds its origins in war .
But everywhere we encounter it slavery is also, at ﬁrst, a domestic
institution. Hierarchy and property may derive from notions of the sacred,
but the most brutal forms of exploitation have their origins in the most
intimate of social relations: as perversions of nurture, love and caring.
Certainly , those origins are not to be found in government. Northwest Coast
societies lacked anything that could be remotely described as an
overarching polity; the closest they came were the or ganizing committees of
annual masquerades. Instead, one ﬁnds an endless succession of great
wooden houses, tiny courts each centring on a title-holding family , the
commoners attached to them, and their personal slaves. Even the rank
system referred to divisions within the household. It seems very likely this
was true in non-agricultural societies elsewhere as well.
Finally , all this suggests that, historically speaking, hierarchy and
equality tend to emer ge together , as complements to one another . Tlingit or
Haida commoners on the Northwest Coast were ef fectively equals in thatthey were all equally excluded from the ranks of title holders and therefore,
in comparison to the aristocrats – with their unique identities – formed a
kind of undif ferentiated mass. Insofar as Californian societies rejected that
entire arrangement, they could be described as self-consciously egalitarian,
but in a quite dif ferent sense. Odd as it may seem, this comes through most
clearly in their enthusiastic embrace of money , and again comparisons with
their northern neighbours are instructive. For Northwest Coast societies,
wealth, which was sacred in every sense of the term, consisted above all of
heirloom treasures, whose value was based on the fact that each was unique
and there was nothing in the world like it. Equality between title holders
was simply inconceivable, much though they might have ar gued about who
ultimately outranked whom. In California, the most important forms of
wealth consisted of currencies whose value lay in the degree to which each
string of dentalium or band of woodpecker scalps was exactly the same, and
could therefore be counted – and, generally speaking, such wealth was not
inherited but destroyed on the owner ’s death.
As our story continues, we will encounter this dynamic repeatedly . We
might refer to it, perhaps, as ‘inequality from below’. Domination ﬁrst
appears on the most intimate, domestic level. Self-consciously egalitarian
politics emer ge to prevent such relations from extending beyond those small
worlds into the public sphere (which often comes to be imagined, in the
process, as an exclusive sphere for adult men). These are the kind of
dynamics that culminated in phenomena like ancient Athenian democracy .
But their roots probably extend much further back in time, to well before
the advent of farming and agricultural societies.6
Gardens of Adonis
The r evolution that never happened: how Neolithic peoples avoided
agricultur e
Let us turn, then, to the origins of farming.
PLATONIC PREJUDICES, AND HOW THEY CLOUD OUR IDEAS
ABOUT THE INVENTION OF F ARMING
‘Tell me this,’ writes Plato:
Would a serious and intelligent farmer , with seeds he cared about
and wished to grow to fruition, sow them in summer in the gardens
of Adonis and rejoice as he watched them become beautiful in a
matter of eight days; or if he did it at all, would he do this for fun
and festivity? For things he really was serious about, would he not
use his farmer ’s craft, plant them in a suitable environment, and be
content if everything he planted came to maturity in the eighth
month?1
The gardens of Adonis, to which Plato is referring here, were a sort of
festive speed farming which produced no food. For the philosopher , they
offered a convenient simile for all things precocious, alluring, but ultimately
sterile. In the dog days of summer , when nothing can grow , the women of
ancient Athens fashioned these little gardens in baskets and pots. Each held
a mix of quick-sprouting grain and herbs. The makeshift seedbeds were
carried up ladders on to the ﬂat roofs of private houses and left to wilt in the
sun: a botanical re-enactment of the premature death of Adonis, the fallen
hunter , slain in his prime by a wild boar . Then, beyond the public gaze ofmen and civic authority , began the rooftop rites. Open to women from all
classes of Athenian society , including prostitutes, these were rites of
grieving but also wanton drunkenness, and no doubt other forms of ecstatic
behaviour as well.
Historians agree that the roots of this women’ s cult lie in Mesopotamian
fertility rites of Dumuzi/T ammuz, the shepherd-god and personiﬁcation of
plant life, mourned on his death each summer . Most likely the worship of
Adonis, his ancient Greek incarnation, spread westwards to Greece from
Phoenicia in the wake of Assyrian expansion, in the seventh century BC.
Nowadays, some scholars see the whole thing as a riotous subversion of
patriarchal values: an antithesis to the staid and proper state-sponsored
Thesmophoria (the autumn festival of the Greek fertility goddess, Demeter),
celebrated by the wives of Athenian citizens and dedicated to the serious
farming on which the life of the city depended. Others read the story of
Adonis the other way round, as a requiem for the primeval drama of serious
hunting, cast into shadow by the advent of agriculture, but not for gotten –
an echo of lost masculinity .2
All well and good, you may say , but what does any of this have to do
with the origins of farming? What have the gardens of Adonis got to do
with the ﬁrst Neolithic stirrings of agriculture some 8,000 years before
Plato? W ell, in a sense, everything. Because these scholarly debates
encapsulate just the sort of problems that surround any modern
investigation of this crucial topic. W as farming from the very beginning
about the serious business of producing more food to supply growing
populations? Most scholars assume, as a matter of course, that this had to be
the principal reason for its invention. But maybe farming began as a more
playful or even subversive kind of process – or perhaps even as a side ef fect
of other concerns, such as the desire to spend longer in particular kinds of
locations, where hunting and trading were the real priorities. Which of these
two ideas really embodies the spirit of the ﬁrst agriculturalists; is it the
stately and pragmatic Thesmophoria, or the playful and self-indulgent
gardens of Adonis?
No doubt the peoples of the Neolithic – the world’ s ﬁrst farmers –
themselves spent a good deal of time debating similar questions. T o get a
sense of why we say this, let’ s consider what is probably the most famous
Neolithic site in the world, Çatalhöyük.IN WHICH WE DISCUSS HOW ÇA TALHÖYÜK, THE WORLD’S
OLDEST T OWN, GOT A NEW HIST ORY
Located on the Konya Plain of central T urkey , Çatalhöyük was ﬁrst settled
around 7400 BC, and continued to be populated for some 1,500 years (for
the purposes of mental calibration, roughly the same period of time that
separates us from Amalafrida, Queen of the V andals, who reached the
height of her inﬂuence around AD 523). The site’ s renown derives partly
from its surprising scale. At thirteen hectares, it was more town than
village, with a population of some 5,000. Y et it was a town with no apparent
centre or communal facilities, or even streets: just a dense agglomeration of
one household after another , all of similar sizes and layout, each accessed
by ladder from the roof.
If the overall plan of Çatalhöyük suggests an ethos of dreary uniformity ,
a maze of identical mud walls, the internal life of its buildings points in
exactly the opposite direction. In fact, another reason for the site’ s fame is
its inhabitants’ distinctly macabre sense of interior design. If you’ve ever
glimpsed the inside of a Çatalhöyük house you will never for get it: central
living rooms, no more than sixteen feet across, with the skulls and horns of
cattle and other creatures projecting inwards from the walls, and sometimes
outwards from the ﬁttings and furnishings. Many rooms also had vivid wall
paintings and ﬁgurative mouldings, and contained platforms under which
resided some portion of the household dead – remains of between six and
sixty individuals in any given house – propping up the living. W e can’ t help
recalling Maurice Sendak’ s vision of a magical house where ‘the walls
became the world all around’.3
Generations of archaeologists have wanted to see Çatalhöyük as a
monument to the ‘origins of farming’. Certainly , it’s easy to understand why
this should be. It is among the ﬁrst lar ge settlements we know of whose
inhabitants practised agriculture, and who got most of their nutrition from
domesticated cereals, pulses, sheep and goats. It seems reasonable to see
them, then, as the very engineers of what has been referred to since the time
of V. Gordon Childe – prehistorian and author of Man Makes Himself
(1936) and What Happened in History  (1942) – as the ‘Agricultural
Revolution’, and when ﬁrst excavated in the 1960s Çatalhöyük’ s
remarkable material culture was interpreted in this way . Clay ﬁgurines of
seated women, including a famous example ﬂanked by felines, wereunderstood as depictions of a Mother Goddess, presiding over the fertility
of women and crops. The wall-mounted ox-skulls (‘ bucrania ’) were
assumed to be those of domestic cattle, dedicated to a taurine deity
responsible for the protection and reproduction of herds. Certain buildings
were identiﬁed as ‘shrines’. All this ritual life was assumed to refer to
serious farming – a Neolithic pageant play , more in the spirit of Demeter
than Adonis.4
But more recent excavations suggest we have been too quick to write of f
Adonis.5 Since the 1990s, new methods of ﬁeldwork at Çatalhöyük
produced a string of surprises, which oblige us to revise both the history of
the world’ s oldest town and also how we think about the origins of farming
in general. The cattle, it turns out, were not domestic: those impressive
skulls belonged to ﬁerce, wild aurochs. The shrines were not shrines, but
houses in which people engaged in such everyday tasks as cooking, eating
and crafts – just like anywhere else, except they happened to contain a
larger density of ritual paraphernalia. Even the Mother Goddess has been
cast into shadow . It is not so much that corpulent female ﬁgurines stopped
turning up entirely in the excavations, but that the new ﬁnds tended to
appear , not in shrines or on thrones, but in trash dumps outside houses with
the heads broken of f and didn’ t really seem to have been treated as objects
of religious veneration.6
Today , most archaeologists consider it deeply unsound to interpret
prehistoric images of corpulent women as ‘fertility goddesses’. The very
idea that they should be is the result of long-outmoded V ictorian fantasies
about ‘primitive matriarchy’. In the nineteenth century , it’s true, matriarchy
was considered the default mode of political or ganization for Neolithic
societies (as opposed to the oppressive patriarchy of the ensuing Bronze
Age). As a result, almost every image of a fertile-looking woman was
interpreted as a goddess. Nowadays, archaeologists are more likely to point
out that many ﬁgurines could just as easily have been the local equivalents
of Barbie dolls (the kind of Barbie dolls one might have in a society with
very dif ferent standards of female beauty); or that dif ferent ﬁgurines might
have served entirely dif ferent purposes (no doubt correct); or to dismiss the
entire debate by insisting we simply have no idea why people created so
many female images and never will, so any interpretations on of fer are
more likely to be projections of our own assumptions about women, genderor fertility than anything that would have made sense to an inhabitant of
Neolithic Anatolia.
All of which might seem a bit pedantic, but in this hair -splitting, as we’ll
see, there’ s a great deal at stake.
IN WHICH WE ENTER SOMETHING OF AN ACADEMIC NO-GO
ZONE, AND DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF NEOLITHIC
MATRIARCHIES
It’s not just the idea of ‘primitive matriarchy’ that’ s become such a bugaboo
today: even to suggest that women had unusually prominent positions in
early farming communities is to invite academic censure. Perhaps it’ s not
entirely surprising. In the same way that social rebels, since the 1960s,
tended to idealize hunter -gatherer bands, earlier generations of poets,
anarchists and bohemians had tended to idealize the Neolithic as an
imaginary , beneﬁcent theocracy ruled over by priestesses of the Great
Goddess, the all-powerful distant ancestor of Inanna, Ishtar , Astarte and
Demeter herself – that is, until such societies were overwhelmed by violent,
patriarchal Indo-European-speaking horse-men descending from the
steppes, or , in the case of the Middle East, Semitic-speaking nomads from
the deserts. How people saw this imagined confrontation became the source
of a major political divide in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries.
To give you a ﬂavour of this, let’ s look at Matilda Joslyn Gage (1826–
98), considered in her lifetime one of the most prominent American
feminists. Gage was also an anti-Christian, attracted to the Haudenosaunee
‘matriarchate’, which she believed to be one of the few surviving examples
of Neolithic social or ganization, and a staunch defender of indigenous
rights, so much so that she was eventually adopted as a Mohawk clan
mother . (She spent the last years of her life in the home of her devoted son-
in-law , L. Frank Baum, author of the Oz books – a series of a dozen
volumes in which, as many have pointed out, there are queens, good
witches and princesses, but not a single legitimate male ﬁgure of authority .)
In Woman, Chur ch, and State  (1893), Gage posited the universal existence
of an early form of society ‘known as the Matriarchate or Mother -rule’,
where institutions of government and religion were modelled on the
relationship of mother to child in the household.Or consider one of Sigmund Freud’ s two favourite students: Otto Gross,
an anarchist who in the years before the First W orld W ar developed a theory
that the superego was in fact patriarchy and needed to be destroyed so as to
unleash the benevolent, matriarchal collective unconscious, which he saw
as the hidden but still-living residue of the Neolithic. (This he set out to
accomplish lar gely through the use of drugs and polyamorous sexual
relationships; Gross’ s work is now lar gely remembered for its inﬂuence on
Freud’ s other favourite student, Carl Jung, who kept the idea of the
collective unconscious but rejected Gross’ s political conclusions.) After the
Great W ar, Nazis began to take up the same story of the ‘Aryan’ invasions
from the exact opposite perspective, representing the imagined, patriarchal
invaders as the ancestors of their master race.
With such intense politicization of what were obviously fanciful readings
of prehistory , it’s hardly surprising that the topic of ‘primitive matriarchy’
became something of an embarrassment – the intellectual equivalent of a
no-go zone – for subsequent generations. But it’ s hard to avoid the
impression something else is going on here. The degree of erasure has been
extraordinary , and far more than is warranted by mere suspicion of an
overstated or outdated theory . Among academics today , belief in primitive
matriarchy is treated as a kind of intellectual of fence, almost on a par with
‘scientiﬁc racism’, and its exponents have been written out of history: Gage
from the history of feminism, Gross from that of psychology (despite
inventing such concepts as introversion and extroversion, and having
worked closely with everyone from Franz Kafka and the Berlin Dadaists to
Max W eber).
This is odd. After all, a century or so does seem more than enough time
for the dust to settle. Why is the matter still so shrouded in taboo?
Much of this present-day sensitivity stems from a backlash against the
legacy of a Lithuanian-American archaeologist named Marija Gimbutas. In
the 1960s and 1970s, Gimbutas was a leading authority on the later
prehistory of eastern Europe. Nowadays, she is often represented as just as
much of an oddball as psychiatric rebels like Otto Gross, accused of having
attempted to revive the most ridiculous of old V ictorian fantasies in modern
guise. This is not only untrue (very few of those who dismiss her work
seem to have actually read any of it), but it has created a situation where
scholars ﬁnd it difﬁcult even to speculate as to how hierarchy and
exploitation came to take root in the domestic sphere – unless one wants toreturn to Rousseau, and the simplistic notion that settled farming somehow
automatically generated the power of husbands over wives and fathers over
children.
In fact, if you read the books of Gimbutas – such as The Goddesses and
Gods of Old Eur ope (1982) – you quickly realize that their author was
attempting to do something which, until then, only men had been allowed to
do: to craft a grand narrative for the origins of Eurasian civilization. She did
so taking as her building blocks the very kind of ‘culture areas’ we
discussed in the last chapter and using them to ar gue that, in some ways
(though certainly not all), the old V ictorian story about goddess-
worshipping farmers and Aryan invaders was actually true.
Gimbutas was lar gely concerned with trying to understand the broad
contours of a cultural tradition she referred to as ‘Old Europe’, a world of
settled Neolithic villages centring on the Balkans and eastern Mediterranean
(but also extending further north), in which, as Gimbutas saw it, men and
women were equally valued, and dif ferences of wealth and status were
sharply circumscribed. Old Europe, by her estimation, endured from
roughly 7000 BC to 3500 BC – which is, again, quite a respectable period of
time. She believed these societies to be essentially peaceful, and ar gued that
they shared a common pantheon under the tutelage of a supreme goddess,
whose cult is attested in many hundreds of female ﬁgurines – some depicted
with masks – found in Neolithic settlements, from the Middle East to the
Balkans.7
According to Gimbutas, ‘Old Europe’ came to a catastrophic end in the
third millennium BC, when the Balkans were overrun by a migration of
cattle-keeping peoples – the so-called ‘ kurgan’ folk – originating on the
Pontic steppe, north of the Black Sea. Kurgan refers to the most
archaeologically recognizable feature of these groups: earthen tumuli
heaped over the graves of (typically male) warriors, buried with weapons
and ornaments of gold, and with extravagant sacriﬁces of animals and
occasionally also human ‘retainers’. All these features attested values
antithetical to the communitarian ethos of Old Europe. The incoming
groups were aristocratic and ‘androcratic’ (i.e., patriarchal), and were
extremely warlike. Gimbutas considered them responsible for the westward
spread of Indo-European languages, the establishment of new kinds of
societies based on the radical subordination of women, and the elevation of
warriors to a ruling caste.As we’ve noted, all this bore a certain resemblance to the old V ictorian
fantasies – but there were key dif ferences. The older version was rooted in
an evolutionary anthropology that assumed matriarchy was the original
condition of humankind because, at ﬁrst, people supposedly didn’ t
understand physiological paternity and assumed women were single-
handedly responsible for producing babies. This meant, of course, that
hunter -gatherer communities before them should be just as matrilineal and
matriarchal, if not more so, than early farmers – something many did indeed
argue from ﬁrst principles, despite a complete lack of any sort of evidence.
Gimbutas, though, was not proposing anything of this sort: she was ar guing
for women’ s autonomy and ritual priority in the Middle Eastern and
European Neolithic. Y et by the 1990s many of her ideas had become a
charter for ecofeminists, New Age religions and a host of other social
movements; in turn, they inspired a slew of popular books, ranging from the
philosophical to the ridiculous – and in the process became entangled with
some of the more extravagant older V ictorian ideas.
Given all this, many archaeologists and historians concluded that
Gimbutas was muddying the waters between scientiﬁc research and pop
literature. Before long, she was being accused of just about everything the
academy could think to throw at her: from cherry-picking evidence to
failing to keep up with methodological advances; accusations of reverse
sexism; or that she was indulging in ‘myth-making’. She was even subject
to the supreme insult of public psychoanalysis, as leading academic journals
published articles suggesting her theories about the displacement of Old
Europe were basically phantasmagorical projections of her own tumultuous
life experience, Gimbutas having ﬂed her mother country , Lithuania, at the
close of the Second W orld W ar in the wake of foreign invasions.8
Mercifully , perhaps, Gimbutas herself, who died in 1994, was not around
to see most of this. But that also meant she was never able to respond.
Some, maybe most of these criticisms had truth in them – though similar
criticisms could no doubt be made of pretty much any archaeologist who
makes a sweeping historical ar gument. Gimbutas’ s arguments involved
myth-making of a sort, which in part explains this wholesale takedown of
her work by the academic community . But when male scholars engage in
similar myth-making – and, as we have seen, they frequently do – they not
only go unchallenged but often win prestigious literary prizes and have
honorary lectures created in their name. Ar guably Gimbutas was seen asmeddling in, and quite consciously subverting, a genre of grand narrative
that had been (and still is) entirely dominated by male writers such as
ourselves. Y et her reward was not a literary prize, or even a place among
the revered ancestors of archaeology; it was near -universal posthumous
viliﬁcation, or , even worse, becoming an object of dismissive contempt.
At least, until quite recently .
Over the last few years, the analysis of ancient DNA – unavailable in
Gimbutas’ s time – has led a number of leading archaeologists to concede
that at least one signiﬁcant part of her reconstruction was probably right. If
these new ar guments, put forward on the basis of population genetics, are
even broadly correct, then there really was an expansion of herding peoples
from the grasslands north of the Black Sea around the time Gimbutas
believed it to have happened: the third millennium BC. Some scholars are
even ar guing that massive migrations took place out of the Eurasian steppe
at that time, leading to population replacement and perhaps the spread of
Indo-European languages across lar ge swathes of central Europe, just as
Gimbutas envisaged. Others are far more cautious; but either way , after
decades of virtual silence, people are suddenly talking about such issues,
and hence about Gimbutas’ s work, again.9
So what about the other half of Gimbutas’ s argument, that Early
Neolithic societies were relatively free of ranks and hierarchies? Before
even beginning to answer this question, we need to clear up a few
misconceptions. Gimbutas in fact never ar gued outright for the existence of
Neolithic matriarchies. Indeed, the term seems to mean very dif ferent things
to dif ferent authors. Insofar as ‘matriarchy’ describes a society where
women hold a preponderance of formal political positions, one can indeed
say this is exceedingly rare in human history . There are plenty of examples
of individual women wielding real executive power , leading armies or
creating laws, but few if any societies in which only women are normally
expected to wield executive power or lead armies or create laws. Even
strong queens like Elizabeth I of England, the Dowager Empress of China
or Ranavalona I of Madagascar did not primarily appoint other women to
be their chief advisors, commanders, judges and ofﬁcials.
In any case, another term – ‘gynarchy’, or ‘gynaecocracy’ – describes the
political rule of women. The word ‘matriarchy’ means something rather
different. There is a certain logic here: ‘patriarchy’, after all, refers not
primarily to the fact that men wield public ofﬁce, but ﬁrst and foremost tothe authority of patriarchs, that is, male heads of household – an authority
which then acts as a symbolic model for , and economic basis of, male
power in other ﬁelds of social life. Matriarchy might refer to an equivalent
situation, in which the role of mothers in the household similarly becomes a
model for , and economic basis of, female authority in other aspects of life
(which doesn’ t necessarily imply dominance in a violent or exclusionary
sense), where women as a result hold a preponderance of overall day-to-day
power .
Looked at this way , matriarchies are real enough. Kandiaronk himself
arguably lived in one. In his day , Iroquoian-speaking groups such as the
Wendat lived in towns that were made up of longhouses of ﬁve or six
families. Each longhouse was run by a council of women – the men who
lived there did not have a parallel council of their own – whose members
controlled all the key stockpiles of clothing, tools and food. The political
sphere in which Kandiaronk himself moved was perhaps the only one in
Wendat society where women did not predominate, and even so there
existed women’ s councils which held veto power over any decision of the
male councils. On this deﬁnition, the Pueblo nations such as Hopi and Zuñi
might also qualify as matriarchies, while the Minangkabau, a Muslim
people of Sumatra, describe themselves as matriarchal for exactly the same
reasons.10
True, such matriarchal arrangements are somewhat unusual – at least in
the ethnographic record, which covers roughly the last 200 years. But once
it’s clear that such arrangements can exist, we have no particular reason to
exclude the possibility that they were more common in Neolithic times, or
to assume that Gimbutas – by searching for them there – was doing
something inherently fanciful or misguided. As with any hypothesis, it’ s
more a matter of weighing up the evidence.
Which takes us back to Çatalhöyük.
IN WHICH WE CONSIDER WHA T LIFE IN THE WORLD’S
MOST F AMOUS NEOLITHIC T OWN MIGHT HA VE ACTUALL Y
BEEN LIKE
Recently , a number of discoveries among the miniature art of Çatalhöyük
appear to show that the female form was a special focus of ritual attention,
skilled artisanship and symbolic reﬂection on life and death. One is a clayﬁgure with typically corpulent female front, transitioning at the back to a
carefully modelled skeleton via arms that look emaciated. Its head, now
lost, was ﬁxed into a hole at the top. Another female ﬁgurine has a tiny
cavity in the centre of her back, into which a single seed from a wild plant
had been placed. And within a domestic platform of the sort used for
burials, excavators found one particularly revealing and exquisitely carved
limestone ﬁgure of a woman. Its detailed rendering clariﬁes an aspect of the
more common ﬁgures made in clay: the sagging breasts, drooping belly and
rolls of fat appear to signify not pregnancy , as once was believed, but age.1 1
Such ﬁndings suggest that the more ubiquitous female ﬁgurines, while
clearly not all objects of worship, weren’ t necessarily all dolls or toys either .
Goddesses? Probably not. But quite possibly matriarchs of some sort, their
forms revealing an interest in female elders. And no equivalent
representations of male elders have been found. Of course, this doesn’ t
mean we should ignore the many other Neolithic ﬁgurines that have
possible phallic attributes, or mixed male-female attributes, or that are so
schematic we shouldn’ t really try to identify them as male or female, or
even as clearly human. Similarly , the occasional links between Neolithic
ﬁgurines and masking – attested both in the Middle East and eastern
Europe12 – may relate to occasions or performances where such categorical
distinctions were deliberately blurred, or even inverted (not unlike, say , the
masquerades of the Paciﬁc Coast of North America, where the deities and
those impersonating them were almost invariably male).
There is no evidence that Çatalhöyük’ s female inhabitants enjoyed better
standards of living than its male ones. Detailed studies of human teeth and
skeletons reveal a basic parity of diet and health, as does the ritual treatment
of male and female bodies in death.13 Yet the point remains that there exist
no similarly elaborate or highly crafted depictions of male forms in the
portable art of Çatalhöyük. W all decoration is another matter . Where
coherent scenes emer ge from the surviving murals, they are mainly
concerned with the hunting and teasing of game animals such as boar , deer ,
bear and bulls. The participants are men and boys, apparently depicted in
different stages of life, or perhaps entering those stages through the
initiatory trials of the chase. Some of these spritely ﬁgures wear leopard
skins; in one deer -baiting scene, all have beards.
One thing to emer ge clearly from the newer investigations at Çatalhöyük
is the way in which household or ganization permeates almost every aspectof social life. Despite the considerable size and density of the built-up area,
there is no evidence for central authority . Each household appears more or
less a world unto itself – a discrete locus of storage, production and
consumption. Each also seems to have held a signiﬁcant degree of control
over its own rituals, especially where treatment of the dead was concerned,
although ritual experts may of course have moved between them. While it’ s
unclear what social rules and habits were responsible for maintaining the
autonomy of households, what seems evident is that these rules were
learned mainly within the household itself; not just through its ceremonies,
but also its micro-routines of cooking, cleaning ﬂoors, resurfacing walls
with plaster , and so on.14 All this is vaguely reminiscent of the Northwest
Coast, where society was a collection of great houses, except that the
inhabitants of these Neolithic houses show no sign of being divided into
ranks.
The residents of Çatalhöyük seem to have placed great value on routine.
We see this most clearly in the fastidious reproduction of domestic layouts
over time. Individual houses were typically in use for between ﬁfty and 100
years, after which they were carefully dismantled and ﬁlled in to make
foundations for superseding houses. Clay wall went up on clay wall, in the
same location, for century after century , over periods reaching up to a full
millennium. Still more astonishing, smaller features such as mud-built
hearths, ovens, storage bins and platforms often follow the same repetitive
patterns of construction, over similarly long periods. Even particular images
and ritual installations come back, again and again, in dif ferent renderings
but the same locations, often widely separated in time.
Was Çatalhöyük, then, an ‘egalitarian society’? There is no sign of any
self-conscious egalitarian ideal in the sense of, say , a concern with
uniformity in the art, architecture or material culture; but neither are there
many explicit signs of rank. Nonetheless, as individual houses built up
histories, they also appear to have acquired a degree of cumulative prestige.
This is reﬂected in a certain density of hunting trophies, burial platforms
and obsidian – a dark volcanic glass, obtained from sources in the highlands
of Cappadocia, some 125 miles north. The authority of long-lived houses
seems consistent with the idea that elders, and perhaps elder women in
particular , held positions of inﬂuence. But the more prestigious households
are distributed among the less, and do not coalesce into elite
neighbourhoods. In terms of gender relations, we can acknowledge a degreeof symmetry , or at least complementarity . In pictorial art, masculine themes
do not encompass the feminine, nor vice versa. If anything, the two
domains seem to be kept apart, in dif ferent sectors of dwellings.
What were the underlying realities of social life and labour at
Çatalhöyük? Perhaps the most striking thing about all this art and ritual is
that it makes almost no reference to agriculture. As we’ve noted, domestic
cereals (wheat and barley) and livestock (sheep and goats) were far more
important than wild resources in terms of nutrition. W e know this because
of or ganic remains recovered in quantity from every house. Y et for 1,000
years the cultural life of the community remained stubbornly oriented
around the worlds of hunting and foraging. At this point, one has to ask
how complete our picture of life at Çatalhöyük really is and where the
largest gaps may lie.
HOW THE SEASONALITY OF SOCIAL LIFE IN EARL Y
FARMING COMMUNITIES MIGHT HA VE WORKED
Only something like 5 per cent of Neolithic Çatalhöyük has been
excavated.15 Soundings and surveys of fer no particular reason to believe
that other parts of the town were substantially dif ferent, but it’ s a reminder
of how little we really know , and that we also have to think about what is
missing from the archaeological record. For instance, it is clear that house
ﬂoors were regularly swept clean, so the distribution of artefacts around
them is far from a straightforward representation of past activities, which
can only be reliably tracked through tiny fragments and residue embedded
in the plaster .16 Traces have also been found of reed mats that covered
living surfaces and furnishings, further disturbing the picture. W e don’ t
necessarily know everything that was happening in the houses, or perhaps
even half of it – or , indeed, how much time was actually spent living in
these cramped and peculiar structures at all.
In considering this, it’ s worth taking a broader look at the site of
Çatalhöyük in relation to its ancient surroundings, which archaeological
science allows us to reconstruct, at least in outline. Çatalhöyük was situated
in an area of wetlands (whence all the mud and clay) seasonally ﬂooded by
the Çarşamba River , which split its course as it entered the Konya Plain.
Swamps would have surrounded the site for much of the year , interspersed
with raised areas of dry land. W inters were cold and damp, summersoppressively hot. From spring to autumn, sheep and goats would have been
moved between areas of pasture within the plain, and sometimes further
into the highlands. Arable crops were most likely sown late in the spring on
the receding ﬂoodplain of the Çarşamba, where they could ripen in as little
as three months, with harvesting and processing in the late summer: fast-
growing grains, in the season of Adonis.17
While all these tasks may have taken place quite close to the town, they
will inevitably have involved a periodic dispersal and reconﬁguration of
working arrangements and of general social af fairs. And, as the rites of
Adonis remind us, another kind of social life altogether may have existed
on the rooftops. It is in fact quite likely that what we are seeing in the
surviving remains of Çatalhöyük’ s built environment are lar gely the social
arrangements prevalent in winter , with their intense and distinctive
ceremonialism focused upon hunting and the veneration of the dead. At that
time of year , with the harvest in, the or ganization required for agricultural
labour would have given way to a dif ferent type of social reality as the
community’ s life shrank back towards its houses, just as its herds of sheep
and goats shrank back into the conﬁnes of their pens.
Seasonal variations of social structure18 were alive and well at
Çatalhöyük, and these carefully balanced alternations seem central to
understanding why the town endured. An impressive degree of material
equality prevailed in the everyday exchanges of family life, within and
between houses. Y et at the same time, hierarchy developed to slower
rhythms, played out in rituals that joined the living to the dead. Shepherding
and cultivation surely involved a strict division of labour , to safeguard the
annual crop and protect the herds – but if so it found little space in the
ceremonial life of the household, which drew its ener gy from older sources,
more Adonis than Demeter .
A certain controversy has arisen, however , concerning just where the
people of Çatalhöyük planted their crops. At ﬁrst, microscopic studies of
cereal remains suggested a dry-land location. Given the known extent of
ancient swamps in the Konya basin, this would imply that arable ﬁelds were
located at least eight miles from the town, which hardly seems plausible in
the absence of donkeys or ox carts (remember , cattle were not yet
domesticated in this region, let alone harnessed to anything). Subsequent
analyses support a more local setting, on the alluvial soils of the Çarşamba
ﬂoodplain.19 The distinction is important for a variety of reasons, not justecological but also historical, even political, because how we picture its
practical realities has direct implications for how we view the social
consequences of Neolithic farming.
We must take an even broader perspective to see exactly why .
ON BREAKING AP ART THE FER TILE CRESCENT
When Çatalhöyük was ﬁrst investigated, in the 1960s, the striking discovery
of houses lined with cattle skulls led many to assume, quite reasonably , that
the plain of Konya was an early cradle of animal domestication. These days
it is known that cattle (and boar) were ﬁrst domesticated 1,000 years before
Çatalhöyük was founded, and in another location altogether: around the
upper reaches of the T igris and Euphrates valleys, which lie further east into
Asia, within the area known as the Fertile Crescent. It was from that general
direction that the founders of Çatalhöyük obtained the basis of their farming
economy , including domestic cereals, pulses, sheep and goats. But they
didn’ t adopt domestic cattle or pigs. Why not?
Since no environmental obstacles were present, one has to assume an
element of cultural refusal here. The best contender for an explanation is
also the most obvious. As Çatalhöyük’ s art and ritual suggests, wild cattle
and boar were highly valued as prey , and probably had been for as long as
anyone could remember . In terms of prestige, there was much to be lost,
perhaps especially for men, by the prospect of surrounding these dangerous
animals with more docile, domestic varieties. Allowing cattle to remain
exclusively in their ancient wild form – a big beast, but also lean, fast and
highly impressive – also meant keeping intact a certain sort of human
society . Accordingly , cattle remained wild and glamorous until around 6000
BC.20
So, what exactly is, or was, the Fertile Crescent? First, it’ s important to
note that this is a completely modern concept, the origins of which are as
much geopolitical as environmental. The term Fertile Crescent was
invented in the nineteenth century , when Europe’ s imperial powers were
carving up the Middle East according to their own strategic interests. Partly
because of the close ties between archaeology , ancient history and the
modern institutions of empire, the term became widely adopted among
researchers to describe an area from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean
(modern Palestine, Israel and Lebanon) to the foothills of the ZagrosMountains (roughly the Iran–Iraq border), crossing parts of Syria, T urkey
and Iraq on the way . Now it is only prehistorians who still use it, to indicate
the region where farming began: a roughly crescent-shaped belt of arable
lands bounded by deserts and mountains.21
Yet in ecological terms, it’ s really not one crescent but two – or no doubt
even more, depending how closely one chooses to look. At the end of the
last glacial period, around 10,000 BC, this region developed in two clearly
distinct directions. Going with the topography , we can discern an ‘upland
crescent’ and a ‘lowland crescent’. The upland crescent follows the foothills
of the T aurus and Zagros Mountains, running north of the modern border
between Syria and T urkey . For foragers at the end of the last Ice Age, it
would have been something of an open frontier; an expanding belt of oak-
pistachio forest and game-rich prairie intersected by river valleys.22 The
lowland crescent to the south was characterized by Pistacia  woodlands, as
well as tracts of fertile terrain bound tightly to river systems or to the shores
of lakes and artesian springs, beyond which lay deserts and barren
plateaus.23
Between 10,000 and 8000 BC, foraging societies in the ‘upland’ and
‘lowland’ sectors of the Fertile Crescent underwent marked
transformations, but in quite dif ferent directions. The dif ferences cannot
easily be expressed in terms of modes of subsistence or habitation. In both
regions, in fact, we ﬁnd a complex mosaic of human settlement: villages,
hamlets, seasonal camps and centres of ritual and ceremonial activity
marked out by impressive public buildings. Both regions, too, have
produced varying degrees of evidence for plant cultivation and livestock
management, within a broader spectrum of hunting and foraging activities.
Yet there are also cultural dif ferences, some so striking as to suggest a
process of schismogenesis, of the sort we described in the previous chapter .
It might even be ar gued that, after the last Ice Age, the ecological frontier
between ‘lowland’ and ‘upland’ Fertile Crescent also became a cultural
frontier with zones of relative uniformity on either side, distinguished
almost as sharply as the ‘Protestant foragers’ and ‘ﬁsher kings’ of the
Paciﬁc Coast.
In the uplands, there was a striking turn towards hierarchy among settled
hunter -foragers, most dramatically attested at the megalithic centre of
Göbekli T epe and at nearby sites like that recently discovered at Karahan
Tepe. In the lowlands of the Euphrates and Jordan valleys, by contrast, suchmegalithic monuments are absent, and Neolithic societies followed a
distinct but equally precocious path of change, which we will shortly
describe. What’ s more, these two adjacent families of societies – let’ s call
them ‘lowlanders’ and ‘uplanders’ – were well acquainted. W e know this
because they traded durable materials with each other over long distances,
among them the same materials, in fact, that we found circulating as
valuables on the W est Coast of North America: obsidian and minerals from
the mountains, and mollusc shells from the coasts. Obsidian from the
Turkish highlands ﬂowed south, and shells (perhaps used as currency)
ﬂowed north from the shores of the Red Sea, ensuring that uplanders and
lowlanders stayed in touch.24
The routes of this prehistoric trade circuit contracted as they progressed
southwards into less evenly populated areas, starting at the Syrian bend of
the Euphrates, winding through the Damascus basin and down into the
Jordan valley . This route formed the so-called ‘Levantine Corridor ’. And
the lowlanders who lived here were devoted craft specialists and traders.
Each hamlet seems to have developed its own expertise (stone-grinding,
bead-carving, shell-processing and so on), and industries were often
associated with special ‘cult buildings’ or seasonal lodges, pointing to the
control of such skills by guilds or secret societies. By the ninth millennium
BC, larger settlements had developed along the principal trade routes.
Lowland foragers occupied fertile pockets of land among the drainages of
the Jordan valley , using trade wealth to support increasingly lar ge, settled
populations. Sites of impressive scale sprang up in such propitious
locations, some, such as Jericho and Basta, approaching ten hectares in
size.25
To understand the importance of trade in this process is to appreciate that
the lowland crescent was a landscape of intimate contrasts and conjunctures
(very similar , in this respect, to California). There were constant
opportunities for foragers to exchange complementary products – which
included foods, medicines, drugs and cosmetics – since the local growth
cycles of wild resources were staggered by sharp dif ferences in climate and
topography .26 Farming itself seems to have started in precisely this way , as
one of so many ‘niche’ activities or local forms of specialization. The
founder crops of early agriculture – among them emmer wheat, einkorn,
barley and rye – were not domesticated in a single ‘core’ area (as once
supposed), but at dif ferent stops along the Levantine Corridor , scatteredfrom the Jordan valley to the Syrian Euphrates, and perhaps further north as
well.27At higher altitudes, in the upland crescent, we ﬁnd some of the earliest
evidence for the management of livestock (sheep and goats in western Iran,
cattle too in eastern Anatolia), incorporated into seasonal rounds of hunting
and foraging.28 Cereal cultivation began in a similar way , as a fairly minor
supplement to economies based mainly on wild resources: nuts, berries,
legumes and other readily accessible foodstuf fs. Cultivation, however , is
rarely just about calories. Cereal production also brought people together in
new ways to perform communal tasks, mostly repetitive, labour -intensive
and no doubt freighted with symbolic meaning; and the resulting foods
were incorporated into their ceremonial lives. At the site of Jerf el-Ahmar ,
on the banks of the Syrian Euphrates – where upland and lowland sectors of
the Fertile Crescent conver ge – the storage and processing of grain was
associated less with ordinary dwellings than with subterranean lodges,
entered from an opening in the roof and suf fused with ritual associations.29
Before exploring some further contrasts between lowlanders and
uplanders, it seems important to consider in a little more detail what these
very earliest kinds of farming were actually like. T o do this, we have to go
deeper into the process of domestication.
ON SLOW WHEA T, AND POP THEORIES OF HOW WE BECAME
FARMERS
In crops, domestication is what happens when plants under cultivation lose
features that allow them to reproduce in the wild. Among the most
important is the facility to disperse seed without human assistance. In
wheat, seeds growing on the stalk are contained by tiny aerodynamic
capsules known as spikelets. As wild wheat ripens, the connection between
spikelet and stem (an element called the rachis) shatters. The spikelets free
themselves and fall to the ground. Their spiky ends penetrate the soil, deep
enough for at least some seed to survive and grow (the other ends project
upwards, equipped with bristle-like awns to deter birds, rodents and
browsing animals).In domestic varieties, these aids to survival are lost. A genetic mutation
takes place, switching of f the mechanism for spontaneous seed dispersal
and turning wheat from a hardy survivor into a hopeless dependant. Unable
to separate from its mother plant, the rachis becomes a locus of attachment.
Instead of spreading out to take on the big bad world, the spikelets stay
rigidly ﬁxed to the top part of the stem (the ‘ear ’). And there they remain,
until someone comes along to harvest them, or until they rot, or are eaten by
animals. So how did these genetic and behavioural changes in crops come
about, how long did it take, and what had to happen in human societies to
make them possible? Historians sometimes like to turn this question on its
head. It is wheat, they remind us, that has domesticated people, just as much
as people ever domesticated wheat.
Yuval Harari waxes eloquent on this point, asking us to think ‘for a
moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the viewpoint of wheat’.
Ten thousand years ago, he points out, wheat was just another form of wild
grass, of no special signiﬁcance; but within the space of a few millennia it
was growing over lar ge parts of the planet. How did it happen? The answer ,
according to Harari, is that wheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens  to
its advantage. ‘This ape’, he writes, ‘had been living a fairly comfortable
life hunting and gathering until about 10,000 years ago, but then began to
invest more and more ef fort in cultivating wheat.’ If wheat didn’ t like
stones, humans had to clear them from their ﬁelds; if wheat didn’ t want to
share its space with other plants, people were obliged to labour under the
hot sun weeding them out; if wheat craved water , people had to lug it from
one place to another , and so on.30
There’ s something ineluctable about all this. But only if we accept the
premise that it does in fact make sense to look at the whole process ‘from
the viewpoint of wheat’. On reﬂection, why should we? Humans are very
large-brained and intelligent primates and wheat is, well … a sort of grass.
Of course, there are non-human species that have, in a sense, domesticated
themselves – the house mouse and sparrow are among them, and so too
probably the dog, all found, incidentally , in Early Neolithic villages of the
Middle East. It’ s also undoubtedly true that, over the long term, ours is a
species that has become enslaved to its crops: wheat, rice, millet and corn
feed the world, and it’ s hard to envisage modern life without them.
But to make sense of the beginnings of Neolithic farming, we surely need
to try and see it from the perspective of the Palaeolithic, not of the present,and still less from the viewpoint of some imaginary race of bour geois ape-
men. Of course, this is harder to do, but the alternative is to slip back into
the realms of myth-making: retelling the past as a ‘just-so’ story , which
makes our present situation seem somehow inevitable or preordained.
Harari’ s retelling is appealing, we suggest, not because it’ s based on any
evidence, but because we’ve heard it a thousand times before, just with a
different cast of characters. In fact, many of us have been hearing it from
infancy . Once again, we’re back in the Garden of Eden. Except now , it’s not
a wily serpent who tricks humanity into sampling the forbidden fruit of
knowledge. It’ s the fruit itself (i.e. the cereal grains).
We already know how this one goes. Humans were once living a ‘fairly
comfortable life’, subsisting from the blessings of Nature, but then we made
our most fatal mistake. Lured by the prospect of a still easier life – of
surplus and luxury , of living like gods – we had to go and tamper with that
harmonious State of Nature, and thus unwittingly turned ourselves into
slaves.
What happens if we put aside this fable and consider what botanists,
geneticists and archaeologists have found out in the past few decades? Let’ s
focus on wheat and barley .
After the last Ice Age, these particular crops were among the ﬁrst to be
domesticated, along with lentils, ﬂax, peas, chickpeas and bitter vetch. As
we’ve noted, this process occurred in various dif ferent parts of the Fertile
Crescent, rather than a single centre. W ild varieties of some of these crops
grow there today , giving researchers the chance to make direct observations
about how those plants behave, and even to reconstruct certain aspects of
the technical process that led, 10,000 years ago, to domestication. Armed
with such knowledge, they can also examine actual remains of ancient
seeds and other plant remains, recovered in the many hundreds from
archaeological sites in the same region. Scientists can then compare the
biological process of domestication (reproduced under technological
conditions similar to those of Neolithic cultivation) with the actual process
that took place in prehistoric times and see how they match up.
Once cultivation became widespread in Neolithic societies, we might
expect to ﬁnd evidence of a relatively quick or at least continuous transition
from wild to domestic forms of cereals (which is exactly what terms like the
‘Agricultural Revolution’ lead us to think), but in fact this is not at all whatthe results of archaeological science show . And despite the Middle Eastern
setting, those ﬁndings do not add up to anything remotely resembling a
Garden of Eden-type story about how humans haplessly stumbled their way
into a Faustian pact with wheat. Just how far we are (or should be) from
that kind of story was already clear to researchers some decades ago, once
they began comparing actual prehistoric rates of crop domestication to
those achieved under experimental conditions.
Experiments of this kind with wild wheat were ﬁrst undertaken in the
1980s.31 What they showed was that the key genetic mutation leading to
crop domestication could be achieved in as little as twenty to thirty years, or
at most 200 years, using simple harvesting techniques like reaping with ﬂint
sickles or uprooting by hand. All it would have taken, then, is for humans to
follow the cues provided by the crops themselves. That meant harvesting
after they began to ripen, doing it in ways that left the grain on the stem
(e.g. cutting or pulling, as opposed to beating grain straight of f the ear with
a paddle), sowing new seed on vir gin soil (away from wild competitors),
learning from errors, and repeating the winning formula next year . For
foragers seasoned in the harvesting of wild crops, these changes need not
have posed major logistical or conceptual challenges. And there may also
have been other good reasons to harvest wild cereals in this manner , besides
obtaining food.
Harvesting by sickle yields straw as well as grain. T oday we consider
straw a by-product of cereal-farming, the primary purpose being to produce
food. But archaeological evidence suggests things started the other way
round.32 Human populations in the Middle East began settling in
permanent villages long before cereals became a major component of their
diets.33 In doing so, they found new uses for the stalks of wild grasses;
these included fuel for lighting ﬁres, and the temper that transformed mud
and clay from so much friable matter into a vital tectonic resource, used to
build houses, ovens, storage bins and other ﬁxed structures. Straw could
also be used to make baskets, clothing, matting and thatch. As people
intensiﬁed the harvesting of wild grasses for straw (either by sickle or
simply uprooting), they also produced one of the key conditions for some of
these grasses to lose their natural mechanisms of seed dispersal.
Now here’ s the key point: if crops, rather than humans, had been setting
the pace, these two processes would have gone hand in hand, leading to the
domestication of lar ge-seeded grasses within a few decades. Wheat wouldhave gained its human handmaidens, and humans would have gained a
plant resource that could be efﬁciently harvested with little loss of seed and
that was eminently storable, but that also required much greater outlays of
labour in the form of land management and the post-harvesting work of
threshing and winnowing (a process which occurs naturally in wild cereals).
Within a few human generations, the Faustian pact between people and
crops would have been sealed. But here again, the evidence ﬂatly
contradicts these expectations.
In fact, the latest research shows that the process of plant domestication
in the Fertile Crescent was not fully completed until much later: as much as
3,000 years after the cultivation of wild cereals ﬁrst began.34 (Once again,
to get a sense of the scale here, think: the time between the putative T rojan
War and today .) And while some modern historians may allow themselves
the luxury of disposing with ‘a few short millennia’ here or there, we can
hardly extend this attitude to the prehistoric actors whose lives we are
trying to understand. At this point, you might reasonably ask what we mean
by ‘cultivation’, and how we can possibly know when it began, if it didn’ t
lead to clear changes in the reproductive behaviour of wild plants? The
answers lie in weeds (and in research methods dreamed up in an inventive
sub-branch of archaeology , known as ‘archaeobotany’).
WHY NEOLITHIC F ARMING T OOK SO LONG T O EVOL VE,
AND DID NOT , AS ROUSSEAU IMAGINED, INVOL VE THE
ENCLOSURE OF FIXED FIELDS
Since the early 2000s, archaeobotanists have been studying a phenomenon
known as ‘pre-domestication cultivation’. Cultivation in general refers to
the work done by humans to improve the life chances of favoured crops,
whether these be wild or domestic. This usually involves, at minimum,
clearing and tilling the soil. Soil preparation induces changes in the size and
shape of wild cereal grains, though such changes need not lead to
domestication (basically they just get bigger). It also attracts other ﬂora that
ﬂourish in disturbed soils, including arable weeds such as clover , fenugreek,
gromwell and indeed members of the colourful crowfoot family (genus
Adonis !), quick to ﬂower and just as quick to die.
Since the 1980s, researchers have accumulated statistical evidence from
prehistoric sites in the Middle East, analysing this evidence for changesover time in grain size and proportions of arable weed ﬂora. Samples now
number in the many tens of thousands. What they show is that, in certain
parts of the region such as northern Syria, the cultivation of wild cereals
dates back at least to 10,000 BC.35 Yet in these same regions, the biological
process of crop domestication (including the crucial switch-over from
brittle rachis to tough) was not completed until closer to 7000 BC – that is
roughly ten times as long as it need have taken – if, that is, humans really
had stumbled blindly into the whole process, following the trajectory
dictated by changes in their crops.36 To be clear: that’ s 3,000 years of
human history , far too long to constitute an ‘Agricultural Revolution’ or
even to be considered some kind of transitional state on the road to farming.
To us, with our Platonic prejudices, all this looks like a very long and
unnecessary delay , but clearly it was not experienced that way by people in
Neolithic times. W e need to understand this 3,000-year period as an
important phase of human history in its own right. It’ s a phase marked by
foragers moving in and out of cultivation – and as we’ve seen, there’ s
nothing unusual or anomalous about this ﬂirting and tinkering with the
possibilities of farming, in just the ways Plato would have despised – but in
no way enslaving themselves to the needs of their crops or herds. So long as
it didn’ t become too onerous, cultivation was just one of many ways in
which early settled communities managed their environments. Separating
wild and domestic plant populations need not have been a major concern
for them, even if it appears that way to us.37
On reﬂection, this approach makes perfectly good sense. Cultivating
domestic cereals, as the ‘afﬂuent’ foragers of the Paciﬁc Coast knew well,
is enormously hard work.38 Serious farming meant serious soil
maintenance and weed clearance. It meant threshing and winnowing after
harvest. All these activities would have got in the way of hunting, wild food
collection, craft production, marriages and any number of other things, not
to mention storytelling, gambling, travelling and or ganizing masquerades.
Indeed, to balance out their dietary needs and labour costs, early cultivators
may even have strategically chosen practices that worked against the
morphological changes which signal the onset of domestication in plants.39
This balancing act involved a special kind of cultivation, which brings us
back full circle to Çatalhöyük and its wetland location. Called ‘ﬂood
retreat’, ‘ﬂood recession’ or décrue  farming, it takes place on the mar gins of
seasonally ﬂooding lakes or rivers. Flood-retreat farming is a distinctlylackadaisical way to raise crops. The work of soil preparation is given over
mostly to nature. Seasonal ﬂooding does the work of tillage, annually
sifting and refreshing the soil. As the waters recede they leave behind a
fertile bed of alluvial earth, where seed can be broadcast. This was garden
cultivation on a small scale with no need for deforestation, weeding or
irrigation, except perhaps the construction of small stone or earthen barriers
(‘bunds’) to nudge the distribution of water this way or that. Areas of high
groundwater , such as the edges of artesian springs, could also be exploited
in this way .40
In terms of labour , ﬂood-retreat farming is not only pretty light, it also
requires little central management. Critically , such systems have a kind of
inbuilt resistance to the enclosure and measurement of land. Any given
parcel of territory might be fertile one year , and then either ﬂooded or dried
out the next, so there is little incentive for long-term ownership or enclosure
of ﬁxed plots. It makes little sense to set up boundary stones when the
ground itself is shifting underneath you. No form of human ecology is
‘innately’ egalitarian, but much as Rousseau and his epigones would have
been surprised to hear it, these early cultivation systems did not lend
themselves to the development of private property . If anything, ﬂood-retreat
farming was practically oriented towards the collective holding of land, or
at least ﬂexible systems of ﬁeld reallocation.41
Flood-retreat farming was an especially important feature of Early
Neolithic economies in the more arid, lowland sectors of the Fertile
Crescent, and particularly the Levantine Corridor , where important sites
often developed on the mar gins of springs or lakes (e.g. Jericho, T ell
Aswad) or on riverbanks (e.g. Abu Hureyra, Jerf el-Ahmar). Because the
densest stands of wild grain crops actually lay in upland areas with higher
rainfall, the inhabitants of such lowland sites had opportunities to isolate
cultivated from wild stock, setting in motion a process of diver gence and
domestication by gathering grains from the highlands and broadcasting
them in lowland, ﬂood-retreat areas. This makes the extremely long
timescale of cereal domestication more striking still. Early cultivators, it
seems, were doing the minimum amount of subsistence work needed to stay
in their given locations, which they occupied for reasons other than
farming: hunting, foraging, ﬁshing, trading and more.
ON WOMAN, THE SCIENTISTRejecting a Garden of Eden-type narrative for the origins of farming also
means rejecting, or at least questioning, the gendered assumptions lurking
behind that narrative.42 Apart from being a story about the loss of
primordial innocence, the Book of Genesis is also one of history’ s most
enduring charters for the hatred of women, rivalled only (in the W estern
tradition) by the prejudices of Greek authors like Hesiod, or for that matter
Plato. It is Eve, after all, who proves too weak to resist the exhortations of
the crafty serpent and is ﬁrst to bite the forbidden fruit, because she is the
one who desires knowledge and wisdom. Her punishment (and that of all
women following her) is to bear children in severe pain and live under the
rule of her husband, whose own destiny is to subsist by the sweat of his
brow .
When today’ s writers speculate about ‘wheat domesticating humans’ (as
opposed to ‘humans domesticating wheat’), what they are really doing is
replacing a question about concrete scientiﬁc (human) achievements with
something rather more mystical. In this view , we’re not asking questions
about who might actually have been doing all the intellectual and practical
work of manipulating wild plants: exploring their properties in dif ferent
soils and water regimes; experimenting with harvesting techniques,
accumulating observations about the ef fects these all have on growth,
reproduction and nutrition; debating the social implications. Instead, we
ﬁnd ourselves waxing lyrical about the temptations of forbidden fruits and
musing on the unforeseen consequences of adopting a technology
(agriculture) that Jared Diamond has characterized – again, with biblical
overtones – as ‘the worst mistake in the history of the human race’.43
Consciously or not, it is the contributions of women that get written out
of such accounts. Harvesting wild plants and turning them into food,
medicine and complex structures like baskets or clothing is almost
everywhere a female activity , and may be gendered female even when
practised by men. This is not quite an anthropological universal, but it’ s
about as close to one as you are ever likely to get.44 Hypothetically , of
course, it is possible that things haven’ t always been so. It’ s even
conceivable that the current situation is really the result of some great
global switch-around of gender roles and language structures that took
place in the last few thousand years – but one would imagine that such an
epochal change would have left other traces, and no one has so much as
suggested what such traces might be. T rue, archaeological evidence of anykind is hard to come by , because aside from charred seeds, very little of
what was done culturally with plants survives from prehistoric times. But
where evidence exists, it points to strong associations between women and
plant-based knowledge as far back as one can trace such things.45
By plant-based knowledge we don’ t just mean new ways of working with
wild ﬂora to produce food, spices, medicines, pigments or poisons. W e also
mean the development of ﬁbre-based crafts and industries, and the more
abstract forms of knowledge these tend to generate about properties of time,
space and structure. T extiles, basketry , network, matting and cordage were
most likely always developed in parallel with the cultivation of edible
plants, which also implies the development of mathematical and
geometrical knowledge that is (quite literally) intertwined with the practice
of these crafts.46 Women’ s association with such knowledge extends back
to some of the earliest surviving depictions of the human form: the
ubiquitous sculpted female ﬁgurines of the last Ice Age with their woven
headgear , string skirts and belts made of cord.47
There is a peculiar tendency among (male) scholars to skip over the
gendered aspects of this kind of knowledge or veil it in abstractions.
Consider Claude Lévi-Strauss’ s famous comments on the ‘savage mind’,
those ‘Neolithic scientists’ he imagined as having created a parallel route of
discovery to modern science, but one that started from concrete interactions
with the natural world rather than generalizing laws and theorems. The
former method of experimentation proceeds ‘from the angle of sensible
qualities’, and according to Lévi-Strauss it ﬂowered in the Neolithic period,
giving us the basis of agriculture, animal husbandry , pottery , weaving,
conservation and preparation of food, etc.; while the latter mode of
discovery , starting from the deﬁnition of formal properties and theories,
only came to fruition much more recently , with the advent of modern
scientiﬁc procedures.48
Nowhere in The Savage Mind  – a book ostensibly dedicated to
understanding that other sort of knowledge, the Neolithic ‘science of the
concrete’ – does Lévi-Strauss even mention the possibility that those
responsible for its ‘ﬂowering’ might, very often, have been women.
If we take these kinds of considerations (instead of some imaginary State of
Nature) as our starting point, then entirely dif ferent sorts of questions arise
about the invention of Neolithic farming. In fact, a whole new languagebecomes necessary to describe it, since part of the problem with
conventional approaches lies in the very terms ‘agriculture’ and
‘domestication’. Agriculture is essentially about the production of food,
which was just one (quite limited) aspect of the Neolithic relationship
between people and plants. Domestication usually implies some form of
domination or control over the unruly forces of ‘wild nature’. Feminist
critiques have already done much to unpack the gendered assumptions
behind both concepts, neither of which seems appropriate to describe the
ecology of early cultivators.49
What if we shifted the emphasis away from agriculture and
domestication to, say , botany or even gardening? At once we ﬁnd ourselves
closer to the realities of Neolithic ecology , which seem little concerned with
taming wild nature or squeezing as many calories as possible from a
handful of seed grasses. What it really seems to have been about is creating
garden plots – artiﬁcial, often temporary habitats – in which the ecological
scales were tipped in favour of preferred species. Those species included
plants that modern botanists separate out into competing classes of ‘weeds’,
‘drugs’, ‘herbs’ and ‘food crops’, but which Neolithic botanists (schooled
by hands-on experience, not textbooks) preferred to grow side by side.
Instead of ﬁxed ﬁelds, they exploited alluvial soils on the mar gins of
lakes and springs, which shifted location from year to year . Instead of
hewing wood, tilling ﬁelds and carrying water , they found ways of
‘persuading’ nature to do much of this labour for them. Theirs was not a
science of domination and classiﬁcation, but one of bending and coaxing,
nurturing and cajoling, or even tricking the forces of nature, to increase the
likelihood of securing a favourable outcome.50 Their ‘laboratory’ was the
real world of plants and animals, whose innate tendencies they exploited
through close observation and experimentation. This Neolithic mode of
cultivation was, moreover , highly successful.
In lowland regions of the Fertile Crescent, such as the Jordan and
Euphrates valleys, ecological systems of this kind fostered the incremental
growth of settlements and populations for three millennia. Pretending it was
all just some kind of very extended transition or rehearsal for the advent of
‘serious’ agriculture is to miss the real point. It’ s also to ignore what to
many has long seemed an obvious connection between Neolithic ecology
and the visibility of women in contemporary art and ritual. Whether one
calls these ﬁgures ‘goddesses’ or ‘scientists’ is perhaps less important thanrecognizing how their very appearance signals a new awareness of women’ s
status, which was surely based on their concrete achievements in binding
together these new forms of society .
Part of the difﬁculty with studying scientiﬁc innovation in prehistory is
that we have to imagine a world without laboratories; or rather , a world in
which laboratories are potentially everywhere and anywhere. Here Lévi-
Strauss is much more on the ball:
… there are two distinct modes of scientiﬁc thought. These are
certainly not a function of dif ferent stages of development of the
human mind but rather of two strategic levels at which nature is
accessible to scientiﬁc enquiry: one roughly adapted to that of
perception and the imagination: the other at a remove from it. It is as
if the necessary connections which are the object of all science,
Neolithic or modern, could be arrived at by two dif ferent routes, one
very close to, and the other more remote from, sensible intuition.51
Lévi-Strauss, as we noted, called the ﬁrst route to discovery a ‘science of
the concrete’. And it’ s important to recall that most of humanity’ s greatest
scientiﬁc discoveries – the invention of farming, pottery , weaving,
metallur gy, systems of maritime navigation, monumental architecture, the
classiﬁcation and indeed domestication of plants and animals, and so on –
were made under precisely those other (Neolithic) sorts of conditions.
Judged by its results, then, this concrete approach was undeniably science.
But what does ‘science of the concrete’ actually look like, in the
archaeological record? How can we hope to see it at work, when so many
thousands of years stand between us and the processes of innovation we are
trying to understand? The answer here lies precisely in its ‘concreteness’.
Invention in one domain ﬁnds echoes and analogies across a whole range of
others, which might otherwise seem completely unrelated.
We can see this clearly in Early Neolithic cereal cultivation. Recall that
ﬂood-retreat farming required people to establish durable settlements in
mud-based environments, like swamps and lake mar gins. Doing so meant
becoming intimate with the properties of soils and clays, carefully
observing their fertility under dif ferent conditions, but also experimenting
with them as tectonic materials, or even as vehicles of abstract thought. As
well as supporting new forms of cultivation, soil and clay – mixed withwheat and chaf f – became basic materials of construction: essential in
building the ﬁrst permanent houses; used to make ovens, furniture and
insulation – almost everything, in fact, except pottery , a later invention in
this part of the world.
But clay was also used, in the same times and places, to (literally) model
relationships of utterly dif ferent kinds, between men and women, people
and animals. People started using its plastic qualities to ﬁgure out mental
problems, making small geometric tokens that many see as direct precursors
to later systems of mathematical notation. Archaeologists ﬁnd these tiny
numerical devices in direct association with ﬁgurines of herd animals and
full-bodied women: the kind of miniatures that stimulate so much modern
speculation about Neolithic spirituality , and which ﬁnd later echoes in
myths about the demiur gic, life-giving properties of clay .52 As we’ll soon
see, earth and clay even came to redeﬁne relationships between the living
and the dead.
Seen this way , the ‘origins of farming’ start to look less like an economic
transition and more like a media revolution, which was also a social
revolution, encompassing everything from horticulture to architecture,
mathematics to thermodynamics, and from religion to the remodelling of
gender roles. And while we can’ t know exactly who was doing what in this
brave new world, it’ s abundantly clear that women’ s work and knowledge
were central to its creation; that the whole process was a fairly leisurely ,
even playful one, not forced by any environmental catastrophe or
demographic tipping point and unmarked by major violent conﬂict. What’ s
more, it was all carried out in ways that made radical inequality an
extremely unlikely outcome.
All this applies most clearly to the development of Early Neolithic societies
in lowland parts of the Fertile Crescent, and especially along the valleys of
the Jordan and Euphrates Rivers. But these communities did not develop in
isolation. For almost the entire period we’ve been discussing, the upland
crescent – following the foothills of the T aurus and Zagros Mountains and
the adjoining steppe – was also home to settled populations, adept in
managing a variety of wild plant and animal resources. They too were often
village dwellers, who adopted strategies of cultivation and herding as they
saw ﬁt, while still deriving the bulk of their diet from non-domesticated
species. But in other ways they are clearly marked out from their lowlandneighbours, their construction of megalithic architecture, including the
famous structures of Göbekli T epe, being just the most obvious. Some of
these groups lived in proximity to lowland Neolithic societies, especially
along the upper reaches of the Euphrates, but their art and ritual suggest a
radically dif ferent orientation to the world, as sharply distinguished from
the latter as Northwest Coast foragers were from their Californian
neighbours.
TO FARM OR NOT T O FARM: IT’S ALL IN YOUR HEAD
(WHERE WE RETURN T O GÖBEKLI TEPE)
At the frontier between the upland and lowland sectors of the Fertile
Crescent stands Göbekli T epe itself. It is actually one of a series of
megalithic centres that sprang up around the Urfa valley , near the modern
border of Syria and T urkey , in the ninth millennium BC.53 Most are still not
excavated. Only the tops of their great T -shaped pillars can be seen
projecting from the deep valley soils. While direct evidence is still lacking,
this style of stone architecture probably marks the apex of a building
tradition that began in timber . Wooden prototypes may also lie behind
Göbekli T epe’s tradition of sculptural art, which evokes a world of fearsome
images, far removed from the visual arts of the lowlands, with their humble
ﬁgurines of women and domestic animals, and hamlets of clay .
In both medium and message, Göbekli T epe could hardly be more
different from the world of early farming communities. Its standing remains
were wrought from stone, a material little used for construction in the
Euphrates and Jordan valleys. Carved on these stone pillars is an imagery
dominated by wild and venomous animals; scavengers and predators,
almost exclusively sexed male. On a limestone pillar a lion rears up in high
relief, teeth gnashing, claws outstretched, penis and scrotum on show .
Elsewhere lurks a malevolent boar , its male sex also displayed. The most
often repeated images depict raptors taking human heads. One remarkable
sculpture, resembling a totem pole, comprises superimposed pairings of
victims and predators: disembodied skulls and sharp-eyed birds of prey .
Elsewhere, ﬂesh-eating birds and other carnivores are shown grasping,
tossing about or otherwise playing with their catch of human crania; carved
below one such ﬁgure on a monumental pillar is the image of a headless
man with an erect penis (conceivably this depicts the kind of immediatepost-mortem erection or ‘priapism’ that occurs in victims of hanging or
beheading as a result of massive trauma to the spinal cord).54
What are these images telling us? Could the taking of trophy heads
among upland populations of the steppe-forest zone be part of the picture?
At the settlement of Nevalı Çori – also in Urfa province, and with similar
monuments to Göbekli T epe – burials with detached skulls were found,
including one of a young woman with a ﬂint dagger still lodged under her
jaw; while from Jerf el-Ahmar – on the Upper Euphrates, where the
lowland crescent approaches the uplands – comes the startling ﬁnd of a
splayed skeleton (again, a young woman) still lying inside a burnt-down
building, prone and missing her head.55 At Göbekli T epe itself, the
chopping of human heads was mimicked in statuary: anthropomorphic
sculptures were made, only to have their tops smashed of f and the stone
heads buried adjacent to pillars within the shrines.56 For all this,
archaeologists remain rightly cautious about linking such practices to
conﬂict or predation; so far , there is only limited evidence for interpersonal
violence, let alone warfare at this time.57
Here we might also consider evidence from Çayönü T epesi, in the Er gani
plain. This was the site of a lar ge prehistoric settlement comprising
substantial houses built on stone foundations, as well as public buildings. It
lay on a tributary of the T igris in the hill country of Diyarbakır , not far north
of Göbekli T epe, and was established around the same time by a community
of hunter -foragers and sometime herders.58 Near the centre of the
settlement stood a long-lived structure that archaeologists call the ‘House of
Skulls’, for the simple reason that it was found to hold the remains of over
450 people, including headless corpses and over ninety crania, all crammed
into small compartments. Cervical vertebrae were attached to some skulls,
indicating they were severed from ﬂeshed (but not necessarily living)
bodies. Most of the heads were taken from young adults or adolescents,
individuals in the prime of life, and ten from children. If any of these were
trophy skulls, claimed from victims or enemies, then they were chosen for
their vitality . The skulls were left bare, with no trace of decoration.59
Human remains in the House of Skulls were stored together with those of
large prey animals, and a wild cattle skull was mounted on an outside wall.
In its later stages of use, the building was furnished with a polished stone
table, erected near the entrance in an open plaza that could have hosted
large gatherings. Studies of blood residues from the surface, and fromassociated objects, led researchers to identify this as an altar on which
public sacriﬁce and processing of bodies took place, the victims both
animal and human. Whether or not the detail of this reconstruction is
correct, the association of vanquished animals and human remains is
suggestive. The House of Skulls met its end in a violent conﬂagration, after
which the people of Çayönü covered the whole complex under a deep
blanket of pebbles and soil.
Perhaps what we’re detecting in the House of Skulls, but in a rather
different form, is a complex of ideas already familiar from Amazonia and
elsewhere: hunting as predation, shifting subtly from a mode of subsistence
to a way of modelling and enacting dominance over other human beings.
After all, even feudal lords in Europe tended to identify themselves with
lions, hawks and predatory beasts (they were also fond of the symbolism of
putting heads on poles; ‘of f with his head!’ is still the most popular phrase
identiﬁed with the British monarchy).60 But what about Göbekli T epe
itself? If the display of trophy heads really was an important aspect of the
site’s function, surely some direct trace would remain, other than just some
suggestive stone carvings.
Human remains are so far rare at Göbekli T epe. Which makes it even
more remarkable that – of the few hundred scraps of prehistoric human
bone so far recovered from the site – some two-thirds are indeed segments
of skulls or facial bones, some retaining signs of de-ﬂeshing, and even
decapitation. Among them were found remnants of three skulls, recovered
from the area of the stone shrines, which bear evidence for more elaborate
types of cultural modiﬁcation in the form of deep incisions and drill-holes,
allowing the skull to dangle from a string or be mounted on a pole.61
In earlier chapters, we’ve explored why farming was much less of a rupture
in human af fairs than we tend to assume. Now we’re ﬁnally in a position to
bring the various strands of this chapter together and say something about
why this matters. Let’ s recap.
Neolithic farming began in Southwest Asia as a series of local
specializations in crop-raising and animal-herding, scattered across various
parts of the region, with no epicentre. These local strategies were pursued, it
seems, in order to sustain access to trade partnerships and optimal locations
for hunting and gathering, which continued unabated alongside cultivation.
As we discussed back in Chapter One , this ‘trade’ might well have hadmore to do with sociability , romance or adventure than material advantage
as we’d normally conceive it. Still, whatever the reasons, over thousands of
years such local innovations – everything from non-shattering wheat to
docile sheep – were exchanged between villages, producing a degree of
uniformity among a coalition of societies across the Middle East. A
standard ‘package’ of mixed farming emer ged, from the Iranian Zagros to
the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, and then spread beyond it, albeit,
as we’ll see, with very mixed success.
But from its earliest beginnings, farming was much more than a new
economy . It also saw the creation of patterns of life and ritual that remain
doggedly with us millennia later , and have since become ﬁxtures of social
existence among a broad sector of humanity: everything from harvest
festivals to habits of sitting on benches, putting cheese on bread, entering
and exiting via doorways, or looking at the world through windows.
Originally , as we’ve seen, much of this Neolithic lifestyle developed
alongside an alternative cultural pattern in the steppe and upland zones of
the Fertile Crescent, most clearly distinguished by the building of grand
monuments in stone, and by a symbolism of male virility and predation that
largely excluded female concerns. By contrast, the art and ritual of lowland
settlements in the Euphrates and Jordan valleys presents women as co-
creators of a distinct form of society – learned through the productive
routines of cultivation, herding and village life – and celebrated by
modelling and binding soft materials, such as clay or ﬁbres, into symbolic
forms.62
Of course, we could put these cultural oppositions down to coincidence,
or perhaps even environmental factors. But considering the close proximity
of the two cultural patterns, and how the groups responsible for them
exchanged goods and were keenly aware of each other ’s existence, it is
equally possible, and perhaps more plausible, to see what happened as the
result of mutual and self-conscious dif ferentiation, or schismogenesis, akin
to what we traced in the last chapter among the recent foraging societies of
America’ s West Coast. The more that uplanders came to or ganize their
artistic and ceremonial lives around the theme of predatory male violence,
the more lowlanders tended to or ganize theirs around female knowledge
and symbolism – and vice versa. W ith no written sources to guide us, the
clearest evidence we can ﬁnd for such mutual oppositions is when things
get (quite literally , in our case) turned on their head, as when one group ofpeople seems to make a great display of going against some highly
characteristic behaviour of their neighbours.
Such evidence is not at all hard to ﬁnd, since lowland villagers, like their
upland neighbours, also attached great ritual signiﬁcance to human heads,
but chose to treat them in ways that would have been utterly foreign to the
uplanders. Let us brieﬂy illustrate what we mean.
Perhaps the most recognizable – and deﬁnitely the most macabre –
objects found in Early Neolithic villages of the Levantine Corridor (Israel,
Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon and the Syrian Euphrates) are ‘skull portraits’.
These are heads that were removed from burials of women, men and
occasionally children in a secondary process, after the corpse had
decomposed. Once separated from the body , they were cleaned and
carefully modelled over with clay , then coated with layers of plaster to
become something altogether dif ferent. Shells were often ﬁxed into the eye
sockets, just as clay and plaster ﬁlled in for the ﬂesh and skin. Red and
white paint added further life. Skull portraits appear to have been treasured
heirlooms, carefully stored and repaired over generations. They reached
their height of popularity in the eighth millennium BC, as Göbekli T epe fell
into decline, when the practice spread as far as Çatalhöyük; there, one such
modelled head was found in an intimate situation, clutched to the chest of a
female burial.63
Ever since these intriguing objects ﬁrst came to light at Jericho in the
early twentieth century , archaeologists have puzzled over their meaning.
Many scholars see them as expressions of care and reverence for ancestors.
But there are literally countless ways one might show respect or grief for
ancestors without systematically removing crania from their places of rest
and modelling life into them by adding layers of clay , plaster , shell, ﬁbre
and pigment. Even in the lowland parts of the Fertile Crescent, this
treatment was reserved for a minority of individuals. More often, human
crania removed from burials were left bare, while others had complex
histories as ritual objects, such as a group of skulls from T ell Qarassa in
southern Syria, found to have been deliberately mutilated around the face in
what appears to have been an act of post-mortem desecration.64
In the Jordan and Euphrates valleys and adjacent coastlands, the practice
of curating human crania has an even longer history , extending back to
Natuﬁan hunter -gatherers, before the onset of the Neolithic period; but
longevity need not imply an entirely local context for later ritualinnovations, such as the addition of decorative materials to make skull
portraits. Perhaps making skull portraits in this particular way was not just
about reconnecting with the dead, but also negating the logic of stripping,
cutting, piercing and accumulating heads as trophies. At the very least, it
offers a further indication that lowland and upland populations in the Fertile
Crescent were following quite dif ferent – and in some ways, mutually
opposed – cultural trajectories throughout the centuries when plants and
animals were ﬁrst domesticated.65
ON SEMANTIC SNARES AND MET APHYSICAL MIRAGES
Back in the 1970s, a brilliant Cambridge archaeologist called David Clarke
predicted that, with modern research, almost every aspect of the old ediﬁce
of human evolution, ‘the explanations of the development of modern man,
domestication, metallur gy, urbanization and civilization – may in
perspective emer ge as semantic snares and metaphysical mirages.’66 It is
beginning to seem like he was right.
Let’s recap a little further . A founding block in that old ediﬁce of human
social evolution was the allocation of a speciﬁc place in history to foraging
societies, which was to be the prelude to an ‘Agricultural Revolution’ that
supposedly changed everything about the course of history . The job of
foragers in this conventional narrative is to be all that farming is not (and
thus also to explain, by implication, what farming is). If farmers are
sedentary , foragers must be mobile; if farmers actively produce food,
foragers must merely collect it; if farmers have private property , foragers
must renounce it; and if farming societies are unequal, this is by contrast
with the ‘innate’ egalitarianism of foragers. Finally , if a particular group of
foragers should happen to possess any such features in common with
farmers, the dominant narrative demands that these can only be ‘incipient’,
‘emer gent’ or ‘deviant’ in nature, so that the destiny of foragers is either to
‘evolve’ into farmers, or eventually to wither and die.
It will by now be increasingly obvious to any reader that almost nothing
about this established narrative matches the available evidence. In the
Fertile Crescent of the Middle East, long regarded as the cradle of the
‘Agricultural Revolution’, there was in fact no ‘switch’ from Palaeolithic
forager to Neolithic farmer . The transition from living mainly on wild
resources to a life based on food production took something in the order of3,000 years. And while agriculture allowed for the possibility  of more
unequal concentrations of wealth, in most cases this only began to happen
millennia after its inception. In the centuries between, people were
effectively trying farming on for size, ‘play farming’ if you will, switching
between modes of production, much as they switched their social structures
back and forth.
Clearly , it no longer makes any sense to use phrases like ‘the Agricultural
Revolution’ when dealing with processes of such inordinate length and
complexity . And since there was no Eden-like state from which the ﬁrst
farmers could take their ﬁrst steps on the road to inequality , it makes even
less sense to talk about agriculture as marking the origins of social rank,
inequality or private property . In the Fertile Crescent, it is – if anything –
among upland groups, furthest removed from a dependence on agriculture,
that we ﬁnd stratiﬁcation and violence becoming entrenched; while their
lowland counterparts, who linked the production of crops to important
social rituals, come out looking decidedly more egalitarian; and much of
this egalitarianism relates to an increase in the economic and social
visibility of women, reﬂected in their art and ritual. In that sense, the work
of Gimbutas – while painted with brush strokes that were broad, sometimes
to the point of caricature – was not entirely wide of the mark.
All this raises an obvious question: if the adoption of farming actually set
humanity , or some small part of it, on a course away  from violent
domination, what went wrong?7
The Ecology of Freedom
How farming ﬁrst hopped, stumbled and bluffed its way ar ound the world
In a way , the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East is unusual precisely
because we know so much about what happened there. Long recognized as
a crucible of plant and animal domestication, it has been more intensively
studied by archaeologists than almost any other region outside Europe. This
accumulation of evidence allows us to begin to tease out some of the social
changes that accompanied the ﬁrst steps to crop and animal domestication,
even to rely to a certain extent on negative evidence. It is difﬁcult, for
instance, to make any sort of convincing ar gument that warfare was a
signiﬁcant feature of early farming societies in the Middle East, as by now
one would expect some evidence for it to have shown up in the record. On
the other hand, there is abundant evidence for the proliferation of trade and
specialized crafts, and for the importance of female ﬁgures in art and ritual.
For the same reasons, we’re able to draw comparisons between the
lowland part of the Fertile Crescent (especially the Levantine Corridor
passing via the Jordan valley) and its upland sector (the plains and foothills
of eastern T urkey), where equally precocious developments in village life
and local industries were associated with the raising of stone monuments
adorned with masculine symbolism and an imagery of predatory violence.1
Some scholars have tried to see all these developments as somehow part of
a single process, heading in the same general direction, towards the ‘birth of
agriculture’. But the ﬁrst farmers were reluctant farmers who seem to have
understood the logistical implications of agriculture and avoided any major
commitment to it. Their upland neighbours, also living settled lives in areas
with diverse wild resources, had even less incentive to tie their existence to
a narrow range of crops and livestock.If the situation in just one cradle of early farming was that complicated,
then surely it no longer makes sense to ask, ‘what were the social
implications of the transition to farming?’ – as if there was necessarily just
one transition, and one set of implications. Certainly , it’s wrong to assume
that planting seeds or tending sheep means one is necessarily  obliged to
accept more unequal social arrangements, simply to avert a ‘tragedy of the
commons’. There is a paradox here. Most general works on the course of
human history do actually assume something like this; but almost nobody , if
pressed, would seriously defend such a point because it’ s an obvious straw
man. Any student of agrarian societies knows that people inclined to
expand agriculture sustainably , without privatizing land or surrendering its
management to a class of overseers, have always found ways to do so.
Communal tenure, ‘open-ﬁeld’ principles, periodic redistribution of plots
and co-operative management of pasture are not particularly exceptional
and were often practised for centuries in the same locations.2 The Russian
mir is a famous example, but similar systems of land redistribution once
existed all over Europe, from the Highlands of Scotland to the Balkans,
occasionally into very recent times. The Anglo-Saxon term was run-rig  or
rundale . Of course, the rules of redistribution varied from one case to the
next – in some, it was made per stirpes , in others according to the number
of people in a family . Most often, the precise location of each strip was
determined by lottery , with each family receiving one strip per land tract of
differing quality , so that nobody was obliged to travel much further than
anyone else to his ﬁelds or to work soil of consistently lower quality .3
Of course, it wasn’ t just in Europe that such things happened. In his 1875
Lectur es on the Early History of Institutions , Henry Sumner Maine – who
held the ﬁrst chair of historical and comparative jurisprudence at Oxford –
was already discussing cases of periodic land redistribution and rundale -
type institutions from India to Ireland, noting that almost up until his own
day, ‘cases were frequent in which the arable land was divided into farms
which shifted among the tenant-families periodically , and sometimes
annually .’ And that in pre-industrial Germany , where land tenure was
apportioned between ‘mark associations’, each tenant would receive lots
divided among the three main qualities of soil. Importantly , he notes, these
were not so much forms of property as ‘modes of occupation’, not unlike
the rights of access found in many forager groups.4 We could go on pilingup the examples (the Palestinian mash’a  system, for instance, or Balinese
subak ).5
In short, there is simply no reason to assume that the adoption of
agriculture in more remote periods also meant the inception of private land
ownership, territoriality , or an irreversible departure from forager
egalitarianism. It may have happened that way sometimes, but this can no
longer be treated as a default assumption. As we saw in the last chapter ,
exactly the opposite seems true in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East, at
least for the ﬁrst few thousand years after the appearance of farming. If the
situation in just one cradle of early farming was so dif ferent from our
evolutionary expectations, then we can only wonder what other stories
remain to be told, in other places where farming emer ged. Indeed, these
other locations are multiplying in light of new evidence, genetic and
botanical, as well as archaeological. It turns out the process was far messier ,
and far less unidirectional, than anyone had guessed; and so we have to
consider a broader range of possibilities than once assumed. In this chapter ,
we’ll show just how much the picture is changing and point towards some
of the surprising new patterns that are starting to emer ge.
Geographers and historians used to believe that plants and animals were
ﬁrst domesticated in just a few ‘nuclear ’ zones: the same areas in which
large-scale, politically centralized societies later appeared. In the Middle
East there was wheat and barley , as well as sheep, goats, pigs and cattle; in
China there was rice ( japonica ), soybeans and a dif ferent variety of pig;
potatoes, quinoa and llamas were brought under domestication in the
Peruvian Andes; and maize, avocado and chilli in Mesoamerica. Such neat
geographical alignments between early centres of crop domestication and
the rise of centralized states invited speculation that the former led to the
latter: that food production was responsible for the emer gence of cities,
writing, and centralized political or ganization, providing a surplus of
calories to support lar ge populations and elite classes of administrators,
warriors and politicians. Invent agriculture – or so the story once went –
and you set yourself on a course that will eventually lead to Assyrian
charioteers, Confucian bureaucrats, Inca sun-kings or Aztec priests carrying
away a signiﬁcant chunk of your grain. Domination – and most often
violent, ugly domination – was sure to follow; it was just a matter of time.Archaeological science has changed all this. Experts now identify
between ﬁfteen and twenty independent centres of domestication, many of
which followed very dif ferent paths of development to China, Peru,
Mesoamerica or Mesopotamia (which themselves all followed quite
different paths, as we’ll see in later chapters). T o those centres of early
farming must now be added, among others, the Indian subcontinent (where
browntop millet, mungbeans, horse gram, indica  rice and humped zebu
cattle were domesticated); the grasslands of W est Africa (pearl millet); the
central highlands of New Guinea (bananas, taroes and yams); the tropical
forests of South America (manioc and peanuts); and the Eastern W oodlands
of North America, where a distinct suite of local seed crops – goosefoot,
sunﬂower and sumpweed – was raised, long before the introduction of
maize from Mesoamerica.6
We know much less about the prehistory of these other regions than we
do about the Fertile Crescent. None followed a linear trajectory from food
production to state formation. Nor is there any reason to assume a rapid
spread of farming beyond them to neighbouring areas. Food production did
not always present itself to foragers, ﬁshers and hunters as an obviously
beneﬁcial thing. Historians painting with a broad brush sometimes write as
if it did, or as if the only barriers to the ‘spread of farming’ were natural
ones, such as climate and topography . This sets up something of a paradox,
because even foragers living in highly suitable environments, and clearly
aware of the possibilities of cereal-farming, often chose not to adopt it. T ake
Jared Diamond:
Just as some regions proved much more suitable than others for
origins of food production, the ease of its spread also varied greatly
around the world. Some areas that are ecologically very suitable for
food production never acquired it in prehistoric times at all, even
though areas of prehistoric food production existed nearby . The
most conspicuous such examples are the failure of both farming and
herding to reach Native American California from the U.S.
Southwest or to reach Australia from New Guinea and Indonesia,
and the failure of farming to spread from South Africa’ s Natal
Province to South Africa’ s Cape.7As we saw in Chapter Five , the failure of farming to ‘reach’ California is
not a particularly compelling way to frame the problem. This is just an
updated version of the old dif fusionist approach, which identiﬁes culture
traits (cat’ s cradles, musical instruments, agriculture and so on) and maps
out how they migrate across the globe, and why in some places they fail to
do so. In reality , there’ s every reason to believe that farming ‘reached’
California just as soon as it reached anywhere else in North America. It’ s
just that (despite a work ethic that valorized strenuous labour , and a regional
exchange system that would have allowed information about innovations to
spread rapidly) people there rejected the practice as deﬁnitively as they did
slavery .
Even in the American Southwest, the overall trend for 500 years or so
before Europeans arrived was the gradual abandonment of maize and beans,
which people had been growing in some cases for thousands of years, and a
return to a foraging way of life. If anything, during this period Californians
were the ones doing the spreading, with populations originally from the east
of the state bringing new foraging techniques, and replacing previously
agricultural peoples, as far away as Utah and W yoming. By the time
Spaniards arrived in the Southwest, the Pueblo societies which had once
dominated the region were reduced to isolated pockets of farmers, entirely
surrounded by hunter -gatherers.8
ON SOME ISSUES OF TERMINOLOGY WHEN DISCUSSING
THE MOVEMENT OF DOMESTIC CROPS AND ANIMALS
AROUND THE GLOBE
In books on world history , you often encounter phrases like ‘crops and
livestock spread rapidly through Eurasia’, or ‘the plant package of the
Fertile Crescent launched food production from Ireland to the Indus’, or
‘maize dif fused northwards at a snail’ s pace.’ How appropriate is such
language when describing the expansion of Neolithic economies many
thousands of years ago?If anything, it seems to reﬂect the experience of the last few centuries,
when Old W orld domesticates did indeed conquer the environments of the
Americas and Oceania. In those more recent times, crops and livestock
were able to ‘spread’ like wildﬁre, transforming existing habitats in ways
that often rendered them unrecognizable within a few generations. But this
has less to do with the nature of seed cultivation itself than with imperial
and commercial expansion: seeds can spread very quickly if those carrying
them have an army and are driven by the need endlessly to expand their
enterprises to maintain proﬁts. The Neolithic situation was altogether
different. Especially for the ﬁrst several thousand years after the end of the
last Ice Age, most people were still not farmers, and farmers’ crops had to
compete with a whole panoply of wild predators and parasites, most of
which have since been eliminated from agricultural landscapes.
To begin with, domestic plants and animals could not ‘spread’ beyond
their original ecological limits without signiﬁcant ef fort on the part of their
human planters and keepers. Suitable environments not only had to be
found but also modiﬁed by weeding, manuring, terracing, and so on. The
landscape modiﬁcations involved may seem small-scale – little more than
ecological tinkering – to our eyes, but they were onerous enough by local
standards, and crucial in extending the range of domestic species.9 Of
course, there were always paths of least resistance, topographical features
and climatic regimes conducive or less conducive to the Neolithic economy .
The east–west axis of Eurasia discussed by Jared Diamond in his Guns,
Germs and Steel  (1997) or the ‘lucky latitudes’ of Ian Morris’ s Why the
West Rules – For Now  (2010) are ecological corridors of this sort.
Eurasia, as these authors point out, has few equivalents to the sharp
climatic variations of the Americas, or indeed of Africa. T errestrial species
can travel across the breadth of the Eurasian continent without crossing
boundaries between tropical and temperate zones. Continents whose
extremities tilt north to south are a dif ferent proposition, and perhaps less
amenable to such ecological transfers. The basic geographical point is
surely sound, at least for the last 10,000 years of history . It explains why
cereals of Fertile Crescent origin are successfully grown today in such
distant locations as Ireland and Japan. It may also explain, to some extent,
why many thousands of years elapsed before American crops – such as
maize or squash (ﬁrst domesticated in the tropics) – were accepted in thetemperate northern part of the American continent, by contrast with the
relatively rapid adoption of Eurasian crops outside their areas of origin.
To what extent can such observations help to make sense of human
history on a lar ger scale? How far can geography go in explaining history ,
rather than simply informing it?
Back in the 1970s and 1980s, a geographer called Alfred W . Crosby came
up with a number of important theories about how ecology shaped the
course of history . Among other things, he was the ﬁrst to draw attention to
the ‘Columbian exchange’, the remarkable crossover of non-human species
set in motion by Europeans’ arrival in the Americas after 1492, and its
transformative ef fect on the global conﬁguration of culture, economy and
cuisine. T obacco, peppers, potatoes and turkeys ﬂowed into Eurasia; maize,
rubber and chickens entered Africa; and citrus fruits, cof fee, horses,
donkeys and livestock travelled to the Americas. Crosby went on to ar gue
that the global ascendance of European economies since the sixteenth
century could be accounted for by a process he called ‘ecological
imperialism’.10
The temperate zones of North America and Oceania, as Crosby pointed
out, were ideally suited to Eurasian crops and livestock; not only because of
their climate, but because they possessed few native competitors and no
local parasites, such as the various funguses, insects or ﬁeld mice that have
developed to specialize in sharing human-grown wheat. Unleashed on such
fresh environments, Old W orld domesticates went into reproductive
overdrive, even going feral again in some cases. Outgrowing and out-
grazing local ﬂora and fauna, they began to turn native ecosystems on their
heads, creating ‘Neo-Europes’ – carbon copies of European environments,
of the sort one sees today when driving through the countryside of New
Zealand’ s North Island, for example; or much of New England. The
ecological assault on native habitats also included infectious diseases, such
as smallpox and measles, which originated in Old W orld environments
where humans and cattle cohabited. While European plants thrived in the
absence of pests, diseases brought with domestic animals (or by humans
accustomed to living alongside them) wreaked havoc on indigenous
populations, creating casualty rates as high as 95 per cent, even in places
where settlers were not enslaving or actively massacring the indigenous
population – which, of course, they often were.Viewed in this light, the success of modern European imperialism owed
more to ‘the Old W orld Neolithic Revolution’ – with its roots in the Fertile
Crescent – than to the speciﬁc achievements of Columbus, Magellan, Cook
and all the rest. And in a sense this is true. But the story of agricultural
expansion befor e the sixteenth century is very far from being a one-way
street; in fact, it is full of false starts, hiccups and reversals. This becomes
truer the further back we go in time. T o appreciate why , we will have to
look beyond the Middle East to consider how the earliest farming
populations fared in some other parts of the world after the end of the last
Ice Age. But ﬁrst there is a more basic point to address: why is our
discussion of these issues conﬁned only to the last 10,000 or so years of
human history? Given that humans have been around for upwards of
200,000 years, why didn’ t farming develop much earlier?
WHY AGRICUL TURE DID NOT DEVELOP SOONER
Since our species came into existence, there have been only two sustained
periods of warm climate of the kind that might support an agricultural
economy for long enough to leave some trace in the archaeological
record.1 1 The ﬁrst was the Eemian inter glacial, which took place around
130,000 years ago. Global temperatures stabilized at slightly above their
present-day levels, sustaining the spread of boreal forests as far north as
Alaska and Finland. Hippos basked on the banks of the Thames and the
Rhine. But the impact on human populations was limited by our then
restricted geographical range. The second is the one we are living in now .
When it began, around 12,000 years ago, people were already present on all
the world’ s continents, and in many dif ferent kinds of environment.
Geologists call this period the Holocene, from Greek holos  (entire), kainos
(new).
Many earth scientists now consider the Holocene over and done. For at
least the last two centuries we have been entering a new geological epoch,
the Anthropocene, in which for the ﬁrst time in history human activities are
the main drivers of global climate change. Where exactly the Anthropocene
begins is a scientiﬁc bone of contention. Most experts point to the Industrial
Revolution, but some put its origins earlier , in the late 1500s and early
1600s. At that time, a global drop in surface air temperatures occurred –
part of the ‘Little Ice Age’ – which natural forces can’ t explain. Quitelikely , European expansion in the Americas played a role. W ith perhaps 90
per cent of the indigenous population eliminated by the ef fects of conquest
and infectious disease, forests reclaimed regions in which terraced
agriculture and irrigation had been practised for centuries. In Mesoamerica,
Amazonia and the Andes, some 50 million hectares of cultivated land may
have reverted to wilderness. Carbon uptake from vegetation increased on a
scale sufﬁcient to change the Earth System and bring about a human-driven
phase of global cooling.12
Wherever one starts it, the Anthropocene is what we have done with the
legacy of a Holocene Age, which in some ways had been a ‘clean sheet’ for
humanity . At its onset, many things really were new . As the ice receded,
ﬂora and fauna – once conﬁned to small refuge zones – spread out to new
vistas. People followed, helping favoured species on their way by setting
ﬁres and clearing land. The ef fect of global warming on the world’ s
shorelines was more complex, as coastal shelves formerly under ice sprang
back to the surface, while others sank below rising seawaters, fed from
glacial melt.13 For many historians, the onset of the Holocene is signiﬁcant
because it created conditions for the origins of agriculture. Y et in many
parts of the world, as we’ve already seen, it was also a Golden Age for
foragers, and it’ s important to remember that this forager paradise was the
context in which the ﬁrst farmers set up shop.
The most vigorous expansion of foraging populations was in coastal
environments, freshly exposed by glacial retreat. Such locations of fered a
bonanza of wild resources. Saltwater ﬁsh and sea birds, whales and
dolphins, seals and otters, crabs, shrimps, oysters, periwinkles and more
besides. Freshwater rivers and lagoons, fed by mountain glaciers, now
teemed with pike and bream, attracting migratory waterfowl. Around
estuaries, deltas and lake mar gins, annual rounds of ﬁshing and foraging
took place at increasingly close range, leading to sustained patterns of
human aggregation quite unlike those of the glacial period, when long
seasonal migrations of mammoth and other lar ge game structured much of
social life.14
Scrub and forest replaced open steppe and tundra across much of this
postglacial world. As in earlier times, foragers used various techniques of
land management to stimulate the growth of desired species, such as fruit
and nut-bearing trees. By 8000 BC, their ef forts had contributed to the
extinction of roughly two-thirds of the world’ s megafauna, which were illsuited to the warmer and more enclosed habitats of the Holocene.15
Expanding woodlands of fered a superabundance of nutritious and storable
foods: wild nuts, berries, fruits, leaves and fungi, processed with a new
suite of composite (‘micro-lithic’) tools. Where forest took over from
steppe, human hunting techniques shifted from the seasonal co-ordination
of mass kills to more opportunistic and versatile strategies, focused on
smaller mammals with more limited home ranges, among them elk, deer ,
boar and wild cattle.16
What is easy to for get, with hindsight, is that farmers entered into this
whole new world very much as the cultural underdogs. Their earliest
expansions were about as far removed as one could imagine from the
missions civilisatrices  of modern agrarian empires. Mostly , as we’ll see,
they ﬁlled in the territorial gaps left behind by foragers: geographical spaces
either too remote, inaccessible or simply undesirable to attract the sustained
attention of hunters, ﬁshers and gatherers. Even in such locations, these
outlier economies of the Holocene would have decidedly mixed fortunes.
Nowhere is this more dramatically illustrated than in the Early Neolithic
period of central Europe, where farming endured one of its ﬁrst and most
conspicuous failures. T o better understand the reasons why this failure
occurred, we will then consider some more successful expansions of early
farming populations in Africa, Oceania and the tropical lowlands of South
America.
Historically speaking, there is no direct connection among these cases;
but what they show , collectively , is how the fate of early farming societies
often hinged less on ‘ecological imperialism’ than on what we might call –
to adapt a phrase from the pioneer of social ecology , Murray Bookchin – an
‘ecology of freedom’.17 By this we mean something quite speciﬁc. If
peasants are people ‘existentially involved in cultivation’,18 then the
ecology of freedom (‘play farming’, in short) is precisely the opposite
condition. The ecology of freedom describes the proclivity of human
societies to move (freely) in and out of farming; to farm without fully
becoming farmers; raise crops and animals without surrendering too much
of one’ s existence to the logistical rigours of agriculture; and retain a food
web sufﬁciently broad as to prevent cultivation from becoming a matter of
life and death. It is just this sort of ecological ﬂexibility that tends to be
excluded from conventional narratives of world history , which present the
planting of a single seed as a point of no return.Moving freely in and out of farming in this way , or hovering on its
threshold, turns out to be something our species has done successfully for a
large part of its past.19 Such ﬂuid ecological arrangements – combining
garden cultivation, ﬂood-retreat farming on the mar gins of lakes or springs,
small-scale landscape management (e.g. by burning, pruning and terracing)
and the corralling or keeping of animals in semi-wild states, combined with
a spectrum of hunting, ﬁshing and collecting activities – were once typical
of human societies in many parts of the world. Often these activities were
sustained for thousands of years, and not infrequently supported lar ge
populations. As we’ll see, they may also have been crucial to the survival of
those ﬁrst human populations to incorporate domesticated plants and
animals. Biodiversity – not bio-power – was the initial key to the growth of
Neolithic food production.
IN WHICH WE CONSIDER A NEOLITHIC CAUTIONAR Y TALE:
THE GRISL Y AND SURPRISING F ATE OF CENTRAL EUROPE’S
FIRST F ARMERS
Kilianstädten, T alheim, Schletz and Herxheim are all names of Early
Neolithic sites on the loess plains of Austria and Germany . Collectively ,
they tell a very unfamiliar story of early agriculture.
In these places, starting around 5500 BC, villages of a similar cultural
outlook – known as the ‘Linear Pottery’ tradition – were established. They
are among the villages of central Europe’ s ﬁrst farmers. But, unlike most
other early farming settlements, each ended its life in a period of turmoil,
marked by the digging and ﬁlling of mass graves. The contents of these
graves attest to the annihilation, or attempted annihilation, of an entire
community: crudely dug trenches or reused ditches containing chaotic
jumbles of human remains, including adults and children of both sexes,
disposed of like so much refuse. Their bones show the telltale marks of
torture, mutilation and violent death – the breaking of limbs, taking of
scalps, butchering for cannibalism. At Kilianstädten and Asparn, younger
women were missing from the assemblage, suggesting their appropriation
as captives.20
The Neolithic farming economy had arrived in central Europe, carried by
migrants from the southeast, and with ultimately catastrophic consequences
for some of those whose ancestors brought it there.21 The earliestsettlements of these newcomers to the central European plains suggest a
relatively free society , with few indicators of status dif ference either within
or between communities. Their basic family units – timber longhouses –
were all approximately the same size; but around 5000 BC, disparities began
to appear between them, as also in the kind of goods placed with their dead.
People enclosed their settlements within lar ge ditches, which yield evidence
of warfare in the forms of arrows, axe heads and human remains. In some
cases, when the sites were overrun, these ditches were turned into mass
graves for the residents they had failed to defend.22
Such is the quality and quantity of accurately dated material that
researchers are able to model demographic trends accompanying these
changes. Their reconstructions have come as something of a surprise. The
arrival of farming in central Europe was associated with an initial and quite
massive upsur ge in population – which is of course exactly what one would
expect. But what followed was not the anticipated ‘up and up’ pattern of
demographic growth. Instead came a disastrous downturn, a boom and bust,
between 5000 and 4500 BC, and something approaching a regional
collapse.23 These Early Neolithic groups arrived, they settled, and then in
many (but, we should emphasize, not all) areas their numbers dwindled into
obscurity , while in others they were bolstered through intermarriage with
more established forager populations. Only after a hiatus of roughly 1,000
years did extensive cereal-farming take of f again in central and northern
Europe.24
Older narratives of prehistory tended simply to assume that Neolithic
colonists held the upper hand over native foraging populations,
demographically and socially; that they either replaced them, or converted
them to a superior way of life through trade and intermarriage. The boom-
and-bust pattern of early farming now documented in temperate Europe
contradicts this picture and raises wider questions about the viability of
Neolithic economies in a world of foragers. T o address these questions, we
need to know a bit more about the foraging populations themselves, and
how they developed their Pleistocene traditions after the Ice Age and into
the Holocene.
Much of what we know about postglacial (Mesolithic) forager populations
in Europe derives from ﬁndings along the Baltic and Atlantic coasts. Much
more is lost to the sea. W e learn a great deal about these Holocene hunter -foragers from their funerary customs. From northern Russia through
Scandinavia, and down to the Breton coast, they are illuminated by ﬁnds of
prehistoric cemeteries. Quite often, the burials were richly adorned. In the
Baltic and Iberian regions they include copious amounts of amber . Corpses
lie in striking postures – sitting or leaning, even ﬂipped on their heads –
suggesting complex and now lar gely unfathomable codes of hierarchy . On
the fringes of northern Eurasia, peat bogs and waterlogged sites preserve
glimpses of a wood-carving tradition that produced decorated ski runners,
sledges, canoes and monuments resembling the totem poles of the Paciﬁc
Northwest Coast.25 Staffs topped with elk and reindeer efﬁgies,
reminiscent of Pleistocene rock art depictions, appear over broad areas: a
stable symbolism of authority , crossing the boundaries of local foraging
groups.26
How did Europe’ s deep interior , where incoming farmers settled, look
from the vantage point of these established Mesolithic populations? Most
probably like an ecological dead end, lacking the obvious advantages of
coastal environments. It may have been precisely this that allowed Linear
Pottery colonists to spread freely west and north on the loess plains to begin
with: they were moving into areas with little or no prior occupation.
Whether that reﬂects a conscious policy of avoiding local foragers is
unclear . What’ s clearer is that this wave of advance began to break as the
new farming groups approached more densely populated coastlands. What
exactly this might have meant in practice is often ambiguous. For example,
human remains of coastal foragers, found on Mesolithic sites in Brittany ,
show anomalous levels of terrestrial protein in the diet of many young
females, contrasting with the general prevalence of marine foods among the
rest of the population. It seems that women of inland origin (who until then
had been eating lar gely meat, not ﬁsh) were joining coastal groups.27
What does this tell us? It may indicate that women had been captured and
transported in raids, conceivably including raids by foragers on farming
communities.28 This can only be speculative; we cannot know for sure that
women moved involuntarily , or even that they moved at the behest of men.
And while raiding and warfare were clearly part of the picture, it would be
simplistic to attribute the initial failure of Neolithic farming in Europe to
such factors alone. W e’ll consider some broader explanations in due course.
First, though, we should take a reprieve from Europe and examine some ofthe success stories of early farming. W e will start with Africa, then move on
to Oceania, and lastly the rather dif ferent but instructive case of Amazonia.
SOME VER Y DIFFERENT PLACES WHERE NEOLITHIC
FARMING FOUND ITS FEET : THE TRANSFORMA TION OF THE
NILE V ALLEY ( c. 5000–4000 BC) AND THE COLONIZA TION OF
ISLAND OCEANIA ( c. 1600–500 BC)
Around the time that Linear Pottery settlements were established in central
Europe, the Neolithic farming economy made its ﬁrst appearance in Africa.
The African variant had the same ultimate origin, in Southwest Asia. It
comprised the same basic suite of crops (emmer wheat and einkorn) and
animals (domestic sheep, goats and cattle – with perhaps some admixture of
local African aurochs). Y et the African reception of this Neolithic ‘package’
could not have been more dif ferent. It is almost as if the ﬁrst African
farmers opened up the package, threw out some of the contents, then
rewrapped it in such strikingly distinct ways that one could easily mistake it
for a completely local invention. As, in many ways, it was.
The place where much of this happened was a region lar gely ignored by
foragers until then, but soon to become a major axis of demographic and
political change: the Nile valley of Egypt and Sudan. By 3000 BC, the
political integration of its lower reaches with the Nile delta would produce
the ﬁrst territorial kingdom of ancient Egypt, facing the Mediterranean.
However , the cultural roots of this and all later Nilotic civilizations lay in
much earlier transformations, linked to the adoption of farming between
5000 and 4000 BC, with their centre of gravity more ﬁrmly in Africa. These
ﬁrst African farmers reinvented the Neolithic in their own image. Cereal
cultivation was relegated to a minor pursuit (regaining its status only
centuries later), and the idea that one’ s social identity was represented by
hearth and home was lar gely thrown out too. In their place came a quite
different Neolithic: supple, vibrant and travelling on the hoof.29
This new form of Neolithic economy relied heavily on livestock-herding,
combined with annual rounds of ﬁshing, hunting and foraging on the rich
ﬂoodplain of the Nile, and in the oases and seasonal streams ( wadis ) of
what are now the neighbouring deserts, which were then still watered by
annual rains. Herders moved periodically in and out of this ‘Green Sahara’,
both west and east to the Red Sea coast. Complex systems of bodily displaydeveloped. New forms of personal adornment employed cosmetic pigments
and minerals, prospected from the adjacent deserts, and a dazzling array of
beadwork, combs, bangles and other ornaments made of ivory and bone, all
richly attested in Neolithic cemeteries running the length of the Nile valley ,
from Central Sudan to Middle Egypt.30
What survives today of this amazing gear now graces the shelves of
museum displays the world over , reminding us that – before there were
pharaohs – almost anyone could hope to be buried like a king, queen, prince
or princess.
Another of the world’ s great Neolithic expansions took place in island
Oceania. Its origins lay at the other end of Asia, in the rice- and millet-
growing cultures of T aiwan and the Philippines (the deeper roots are in
China). Around 1600 BC a striking dispersal of farming groups took place,
starting here and ending over 5,000 miles to the east in Polynesia.
Known as the ‘Lapita horizon’ (after the site in New Caledonia where its
decorated pottery was ﬁrst identiﬁed), this precocious expansion – which
called into being the world’ s ﬁrst deep-ocean outrigger canoes – is often
connected to the spread of Austronesian languages. Rice and millet, poorly
suited to tropical climates, were jettisoned in its early stages of dispersal.
But as the Lapita horizon advanced, their place was taken by a rich
admixture of tubers and fruit crops encountered along the way , together
with a growing menagerie of animal domesticates (pigs, joined by dogs and
chickens; rats too hitched along for the ride). These species travelled with
Lapita colonists to previously uninhabited islands – among them Fiji, T onga
and Samoa – where they put down roots (quite literally , in the case of taro
and other tubers).31
Like the Linear Pottery farmers of central Europe, Lapita groups seem to
have avoided established centres of population. They gave a wide berth to
the forager stronghold of Australia, and skirted lar gely clear of Papua New
Guinea, where a local form of farming was already well established in the
uplands around the W ahgi valley .32 On vir gin islands and beside vacant
lagoons they founded their villages, comprising houses perched on stilts.
With stone adzes, a mainstay of their travelling toolkit, they cleared patches
of forest to make gardens for their crops – taroes, yams and bananas –
which they supplemented with animal domesticates and a rich diet of ﬁsh,
shellﬁsh and marine turtles, wild birds and fruit bats.33Unlike Europe’ s ﬁrst farmers, the carriers of the Lapita horizon
diversiﬁed their economy continuously as they spread. And this was not just
true of their crops and animals. V oyaging eastwards, Lapita peoples left a
trail of distinctive pottery , their most consistent signal in the archaeological
record. Along the way they also encountered many new materials. The most
valued, such as particular types of shell, were crafted into multi-media
ornaments – arm rings, necklaces, pendants – which left a trace on
Melanesian and Polynesian island culture that was still visible many
centuries later , when Captain Cook (unwittingly retracing the steps of
Lapita) caught sight of New Caledonia in 1774 and wrote that it reminded
him of Scotland.
Lapita prestige items also included bird-feather headdresses (depicted on
the pottery), ﬁne pandanus leaf mats and obsidian. Obsidian blades,
circulating thousands of miles away from their sources in the Bismarck
Archipelago, were used in tattooing and scariﬁcation to apply pigment and
plant matter to the skin. While the tattoos themselves do not survive, the
impressed decoration of Lapita pots gives some hint of their underlying
schema, transferred from skin to ceramic. More recent traditions of
Polynesian tattooing and body art – ‘wrapping the body in images’, as a
famous anthropological study puts it – remind us how little we really know
of the vibrant conceptual worlds of earlier times, and those who ﬁrst carried
such practices across remote Paciﬁc island-scapes.34
ON THE CASE OF AMAZONIA, AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF
‘PLA Y FARMING’
On ﬁrst inspection, these three variations on ‘the Neolithic’ – European,
African, Oceanic – might seem to have almost nothing in common.
However , all share two important features. First, each involved a serious
commitment to farming. Of the three, the Linear Pottery culture of Europe
enmeshed itself most deeply in the raising of cereals and livestock. The Nile
valley was fully wedded to its herds, as was the Lapita to its pigs and yams.
In every case, the species in question was fully domesticated, reliant on
human intervention for its survival, and was no longer able to reproduce
unassisted in the wild. For their part, the people in question had oriented
their lives around the needs of certain plants and animals; enclosing,
protecting and breeding those species was a perennial feature of theirexistence and a cornerstone of their diets. All of them had become ‘serious’
farmers.
Second, all three cases involved a tar geted spread of farming to lands
largely uninhabited by existing populations. The highly mobile Neolithic of
the Nile valley extended seasonally into the adjacent steppe-desert, but
avoided regions that were already densely settled, such as the Nile delta, the
Sudanese gezira  and the major oases (including the Fayum, where lakeside
ﬁsher -foragers prevailed, adopting and abandoning farming practices
largely as it suited them).35 Similarly , the Linear Pottery culture of Europe
took root in niches left open by Mesolithic foragers, such as patches of
loess soil and unused river levees. The Lapita horizon, too, was a relatively
closed system, interacting with others when necessary , but otherwise
enfolding new resources into its own pattern of life. Serious farmers tended
to form societies with hard boundaries, ethnic and, in some cases, also
linguistic.36
But not all early farming expansions were of this ‘serious’ variety . In the
lowland tropics of South America, archaeological research has uncovered a
distinctly more playful tradition of Holocene food production. Similar
practices were still widely in evidence in Amazonia until recently , such as
we found among the Nambikwara of Brazil’ s Mato Grosso region. W ell into
the twentieth century , they spent the rainy season in riverside villages,
clearing gardens and orchards to grow a panoply of crops including sweet
and bitter manioc, maize, tobacco, beans, cotton, groundnuts, gourds and
more besides. Cultivation was a relaxed af fair, with little ef fort spent on
keeping dif ferent species apart. And as the dry season commenced, these
tangled house gardens were abandoned altogether . The entire group
dispersed into small nomadic bands to hunt and forage, only to begin the
whole process again the following year , often in a dif ferent location.
In Greater Amazonia, such seasonal moves in and out of farming are
documented among a wide range of indigenous societies and are of
considerable antiquity .37 So is the habit of keeping pets. It is often stated
that Amazonia has no indigenous animal domesticates, and from a
biological standpoint this is true. From a cultural perspective, things look
more complicated. Many rainforest groups carry with them what can only
be described as a small zoo comprising tamed forest creatures: monkeys,
parrots, collared peccaries, and so on. These pets are often the orphaned
offspring of animals hunted and killed for food. T aken in by human foster -parents, fed and nurtured through infancy , they become utterly dependent
on their masters. This subservience lasts into maturity . Pets are not eaten.
Nor are their keepers interested in breeding them. They live as individual
members of the community , who treat them much like children, as subjects
of affection and sources of amusement.38
Amazonian societies blur our conventional distinction between ‘wild’
and ‘domestic’ in other ways. Animals they routinely hunt and capture for
food include peccary , agouti and others we would classify as ‘wild’. Y et
these same species are locally considered as already domesticated, at least
in the sense of being subjects of supernatural ‘masters of the animals’ who
protect them and to whom they are bound. ‘Master ’ or ‘Mistress of the
Animals’ ﬁgures are actually very common in hunting societies; sometimes
they take the form of a huge or perfect specimen of a certain type of beast, a
kind of embodiment of the species, but at the same time they appear as
human or humanlike owners of the species, to whom the souls of all deer , or
seals, or caribou must be returned after hunters take them. In Amazonia,
what this means in practice is that people avoid intervening in the
reproduction of those particular species lest they usurp the role of spirits.
In other words, there was no obvious cultural route, in Amazonia, that
might lead humans to become both the primary carers for and consumers of
other species; relationships were either too remote (in the case of game) or
too intimate (in the case of pets). W e are dealing here with people who
possess all the requisite ecological skills to raise crops and livestock, but
who nevertheless pull back from the threshold, maintaining a careful
balancing act between forager (or better , perhaps, forester) and farmer .39
Amazonia shows how this ‘in-and-out-of-farming’ game could be far more
than a transient af fair. It seems to have played out over thousands of years,
since during that time there is evidence of plant domestication and land
management, but little commitment to agriculture.40 From 500 BC, this
neotropical mode of food production expanded from its heartlands on the
Orinoco and Rio Negro, tracking river systems through the rainforest, and
ultimately becoming established all the way from Bolivia to the Antilles. Its
legacy is clearest in the distribution of living and historical groups speaking
languages of the Arawak family .41
Arawak-speaking groups were famed in recent centuries as master
blenders of culture – traders and diplomats, for ging diverse alliances, oftenfor commercial advantage. Over 2,000 years ago, a similar process of
strategic cultural mixing (quite unlike the avoidance strategies of more
‘serious’ farmers) seems to have brought about the conver gence of the
Amazon basin into a regional system. Arawak languages and their
derivatives are spoken all along the várzea  (alluvial terraces), from the
mouths of the Orinoco and Amazon to their Peruvian headwaters. But their
users have little in the way of shared genetic ancestry . The various dialects
are structurally closer to those of their non-Arawak neighbours than to each
other , or to any putative Ur-language.
The impression is not at all of a uniform spread, but a tar geted
interweaving of groups along the main routes of canoe-borne transport and
trade. The result was an interlaced network of cultural exchange, lacking
clear boundaries or a centre. The latticework schema on Amazonian pottery ,
cotton fabrics and skin painting – recurring in strikingly similar styles from
one edge of the rainforest to the other – seem to model these connective
principles, entangling human bodies in a complex cartography of
relations.42
Until quite recently , Amazonia was regarded as a timeless refuge of solitary
tribes, about as close to Rousseau or Hobbes’ s State of Nature as one could
possibly get. As we’ve seen, such romantic notions persisted in
anthropology well into the 1980s, through studies that cast groups like the
Yanomami in the role of ‘contemporary ancestors’, windows on to our
evolutionary past. Research in the ﬁelds of archaeology and ethnohistory is
now overturning this picture.
We now know that, by the beginning of the Christian era, the Amazonian
landscape was already studded with towns, terraces, monuments and
roadways, reaching all the way from the highland kingdoms of Peru to the
Caribbean. The ﬁrst Europeans to arrive there in the sixteenth century
described lively ﬂoodplain settlements governed by paramount chiefs who
dominated their neighbours. It is tempting to dismiss these accounts as
adventurers’ hyperbole, designed to impress the sponsors at home – but, as
archaeological science brings the outlines of this rainforest civilization into
view , it is increasingly difﬁcult to do so. Partly this new understanding is
the result of controlled research; partly a consequence of industrial
deforestation, which in the Upper Amazon basin (looking west to theAndes) has exposed from the canopy a tradition of monumental earthworks,
executed to precise geometrical plans and linked by road systems.43
What exactly was the reason for this ancient Amazonian efﬂorescence?
Up until a few decades ago, all these developments were explained as the
result of yet another ‘Agricultural Revolution’. It was supposed that, in the
ﬁrst millennium BC, intensiﬁed manioc-farming raised Amazonian
population levels, generating a wave of human expansion throughout the
lowland tropics. The basis for this hypothesis lay in ﬁnds of domesticated
manioc, dating back as early as 7000 BC; more recently , in southern
Amazonia, the cultivation of maize and squash has been traced back to
similarly early periods.44 Yet there is little evidence for widespread
farming of these crops in the key period of cultural conver gence, beginning
around 500 BC. In fact, manioc only seems to have become a staple crop
after  European contact. All this implies that at least some early inhabitants
of Amazonia were well aware of plant domestication but did not select it as
the basis of their economy , opting instead for a more ﬂexible kind of
agroforestry .45
Modern rainforest agriculture relies on slash-and-burn techniques,
labour -intensive methods geared to the extensive cultivation of a small
number of crops. The more ancient mode, which we’ve been describing,
allowed for a much wider range of cultivars, grown in doorstep gardens or
small forest clearings close to settlements. Such ancient plant nurseries
rested on special soils (or , more strictly , ‘anthrosols’), which are locally
called terra pr eta de índio  (‘black earth of the Indians’) and terra mulata
(‘brown earth’): dark earths with carrying capacities well in excess of
ordinary tropical soils. The dark earths owe their fertility to absorption of
organic by-products such as food residues, excrement and charcoal from
everyday village life (forming terras pr etas) and/or earlier episodes of
localized burning and cultivation ( terras mulatas ).46 Soil enrichment in
ancient Amazonia was a slow and ongoing process, not an annual task.
‘Play farming’ of this sort, in the Amazon as elsewhere, has had its recent
advantages for indigenous peoples. Elaborate and unpredictable subsistence
routines are an excellent deterrent against the colonial State: an ecology of
freedom in the literal sense. It is difﬁcult to tax and monitor a group that
refuses to stay in one location, obtaining its livelihood without making
long-term commitments to ﬁxed resources, or growing much of its food
invisibly under ground (as with tubers and other root vegetables).47 Whilethis may be so, the deeper history of the American tropics shows that
similarly loose and ﬂexible patterns of food production sustained
civilizational growth on a continent-wide scale, long before Europeans
arrived.
In fact, farming of this particular sort (‘low-level food production’ is the
more technical term) has characterized a very wide range of Holocene
societies, including the earliest cultivators of the Fertile Crescent and
Mesoamerica.48 In Mexico, domestic forms of squash and maize existed by
7000 BC.49 Yet these crops only became staple foods around 5,000 years
later. Similarly , in the Eastern W oodlands of North America local seed
crops were cultivated by 3000 BC, but there was no ‘serious farming’ until
around AD 1000.50 China follows a similar pattern. Millet-farming began
on a small scale around 8000 BC, on the northern plains, as a seasonal
complement to foraging and dog-assisted hunting. It remained so for 3,000
years, until the introduction of cultivated millets into the basin of the
Yellow River . Similarly , on the lower and middle reaches of the Y angtze,
fully domesticated rice strains only appear ﬁfteen centuries after the ﬁrst
cultivation of wild rice in paddy ﬁelds. It might have even taken longer
were it not for a snap of global cooling around 5000 BC, which depleted
wild rice stands and nut harvests.51
In both parts of China, long after their domestication pigs still came
second to wild boar and deer in terms of dietary signiﬁcance. This was also
the case in the wooded uplands of the Fertile Crescent, where Çayönü with
its House of Skulls is located, and where human–pig relations long
remained more a matter of ﬂirtation than full domestication.52 So while it’ s
tempting to hold Amazonia up as a ‘New W orld’ alternative to the ‘Old
World Neolithic’, the truth is that Holocene developments in both
hemispheres are starting to look increasingly similar , at least in terms of the
overall pace of change. And in both cases, they look increasingly un-
revolutionary . In the beginning, many of the world’ s farming societies were
Amazonian in spirit. They hovered at the threshold of agriculture while
remaining wedded to the cultural values of hunting and foraging. The
‘smiling ﬁelds’ of Rousseau’ s Discourse  still lay far of f in the future.
It may be that further research reveals demographic ﬂuctuations among
early farming (or forester -farmer) populations in Amazonia, Oceania or
even among the ﬁrst herding peoples of the Nile valley , similar to thosenow observed for central Europe. Indeed, some sort of decline, or at least
major reconﬁguration of settlement, took place in the Fertile Crescent itself
during the seventh millennium BC.53 At any rate, we shouldn’ t be too
categorical about the contrasts among these various regions, given the
different amounts of evidence available for each. Still, based on what is
currently known, we can at least reframe our initial question and ask: why
did Neolithic farmers in certain parts of Europe initially suf fer population
collapse on a scale currently unknown, or undetected elsewhere?
Clues lie in the tiniest of details.
Cereal-farming, as it turns out, underwent some important changes
during its transfer from Southwest Asia to central Europe via the Balkans.
Originally there were three kinds of wheat (einkorn, emmer and free
threshing) and two kinds of barley (hulled and naked) under cultivation, but
also ﬁve dif ferent pulses (pea, lentil, bitter vetch, chickpea and grass pea).
By contrast, the majority of Linear Pottery sites contain just glume wheats
(emmer and einkorn) and one or two kinds of pulse. The Neolithic economy
had become increasingly narrow and uniform, a diminished subset of the
Middle Eastern original. Furthermore, the loess landscapes of central
Europe of fered little topographical variability and few opportunities to add
new resources, while dense forager populations limited expansion towards
the coasts.54
Almost everything came to revolve around a single food web for
Europe’ s earliest farmers. Cereal-farming fed the community . Its by-
products – chaf f and straw – provided fuel, fodder for their animals, as well
as basic materials for construction, including temper for pottery and daub
for houses. Livestock supplied occasional meat, dairy and wool, as well as
manure for gardens.55 With their wattle-and-daub longhouses and sparse
material culture, these ﬁrst European farming settlements bear a peculiar
resemblance to the rural peasant societies of much later eras. Most likely ,
they were also subject to some of the same weaknesses – not just periodic
raiding from the outside, but also internal labour crunches, soil exhaustion,
disease and harvest failures across a whole string of like-for -like
communities, with little scope for mutual aid.
Neolithic farming was an experiment that could fail – and, on occasion,
did.BUT WHY DOES IT ALL MA TTER? (A QUICK REPRISE ON THE
DANGERS OF TELEOLOGICAL REASONING)
In this chapter we have tracked the fate of some of the world’ s ﬁrst farmers
as they hopped, stumbled and bluf fed their way around the globe, with
mixed success. But what does this tell us about the overall course of human
history? Surely , the sceptical reader might object, what matters in the wider
scheme of things are not the ﬁrst faltering steps towards agriculture, but its
long-term ef fects. After all, by no later than 2000 BC agriculture was
supporting great cities, from China to the Mediterranean; and by 500 BC
food-producing societies of one sort or another had colonized pretty much
all of Eurasia, with the exception of southern Africa, the sub-Arctic region
and a handful of subtropical islands.
A sceptic might continue: agriculture alone could unlock the carrying
capacity of lands that foragers were either unable or unwilling to exploit to
anything like the same degree. So long as people were willing to give up
their mobility and settle, even small parcels of arable soil could be made to
yield food surpluses, especially once ploughs and irrigation were
introduced. Even if there were temporary downturns, or even catastrophic
failures, over the long term the odds were surely always stacked in favour
of those who could intensify land use to sustain ever lar ger and denser
populations. And let’ s face it, the same sceptic might conclude, the world’ s
population could only grow from perhaps 5 million at the start of the
Holocene to 900 million by AD 1800, and now to billions, because of
agriculture.
How too, for that matter , could such lar ge populations be fed, without
chains of command to or ganize the masses, formal ofﬁces of leadership;
full-time administrators, soldiers, police, and other non-food-producers,
who in turn could only be supported by the surpluses that agriculture
provides? These seem like reasonable questions to ask, and those who make
the ﬁrst point almost invariably make the second. But in doing so, they risk
parting company with history . You can’ t simply jump from the beginning of
the story to the end, and then just assume you know what happened in the
middle. W ell, you can, but then you are slipping back into the very fairy
tales we’ve been dealing with throughout this book. So instead, let’ s recap
very brieﬂy what we’ve learned about the origins and spread of farming,and then turn to examine some of the more dramatic things that actually did
happen to human societies over the last 5,000 or so years.
Farming, as we can now see, often started out as an economy of
deprivation: you only invented it when there was nothing else to be done,
which is why it tended to happen ﬁrst in areas where wild resources were
thinnest on the ground. It was the odd one out in the strategies of the Early
Holocene, but it had explosive growth potential, especially after domestic
livestock were added to cereal crops. Even so, it was the new kid on the
block. Since the ﬁrst farmers made more rubbish, and often built houses of
baked mud, they are also more visible to archaeologists. That’ s one reason
why imaginative in-ﬁlling is necessary if we want to avoid missing the
action going on in much richer environments at the same time, among
populations still lar gely reliant on wild resources.
Seasonally erected monuments like those of Göbekli T epe or Lake
Shigirskoe are as clear a signal as one could wish for that big things were
afoot among Holocene hunter -ﬁsher -gatherers. But what were all the non-
farming people doing, and where were they living, for the rest of the time?
Upland forested areas, like the uplands of eastern T urkey or the foothills of
the Urals, are one candidate, but since most construction was in wood, very
little of this habitation survives. Most likely , the lar gest communities were
concentrated around lakes, rivers and coastlands, and especially at their
junctures: delta environments – such as those of southern Mesopotamia, the
lower reaches of the Nile and the Indus – where many of the world’ s ﬁrst
cities arose, and to which we must now turn in order to ﬁnd out exactly
what living in lar ge and densely populated settlements really did (and did
not) imply for the development of human societies.8
Imaginary Cities
Eurasia’ s ﬁrst urbanites – in Mesopotamia, the Indus valley , Ukraine and
China – and how they built cities without kings
Cities begin in the mind.
Or so proposed Elias Canetti, a novelist and social philosopher often
written of f as one of those of fbeat mid-century central European thinkers no
one knows quite what to do with. Canetti speculated that Palaeolithic
hunter -gatherers living in small communities must, inevitably , have spent
time wondering what lar ger ones would be like. Proof, he felt, was on the
walls of caves, where they faithfully depicted herd animals that moved
together in uncountable masses. How could they not have wondered what
human herds might be like, in all their terrible glory? No doubt they also
considered the dead, outnumbering the living by orders of magnitude. What
if everyone who’d ever died were all in one place? What would that be
like? These ‘invisible crowds’, Canetti proposed, were in a sense the ﬁrst
human cities, even if they existed only in the imagination.
All this might seem idle speculation (in fact, speculation about
speculation), but current advances in the study of human cognition suggest
that Canetti had put his ﬁnger on something important, something almost
everyone else had overlooked. V ery lar ge social units are always, in a sense,
imaginary . Or, to put it in a slightly dif ferent way: there is always a
fundamental distinction between the way one relates to friends, family ,
neighbourhood, people and places that we actually know directly , and the
way one relates to empires, nations and metropolises, phenomena that exist
largely, or at least most of the time, in our heads. Much of social theory can
be seen as an attempt to square these two dimensions of our experience.In the standard, textbook version of human history , scale is crucial. The tiny
bands of foragers in which humans were thought to have spent most of their
evolutionary history could be relatively democratic and egalitarian precisely
because they were small. It’ s common to assume – and is often stated as
self-evident fact – that our social sensibilities, even our capacity to keep
track of names and faces, are lar gely determined by the fact that we spent
95 per cent of our evolutionary history in tiny groups of at best a few dozen
individuals. W e’re designed to work in small teams. As a result, lar ge
agglomerations of people are often treated as if they were by deﬁnition
somewhat unnatural, and humans as psychologically ill equipped to handle
life inside them. This is the reason, the ar gument often goes, that we require
such elaborate ‘scaf folding’ to make lar ger communities work: such things
as urban planners, social workers, tax auditors and police.1
If so, it would make perfect sense that the appearance of the ﬁrst cities,
the ﬁrst truly lar ge concentrations of people permanently settled in one
place, would also correspond to the rise of states. For a long time, the
archaeological evidence – from Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, Central
America and elsewhere – did appear to conﬁrm this. If you put enough
people in one place, the evidence seemed to show , they would almost
inevitably develop writing or something like it, together with
administrators, storage and redistribution facilities, workshops and
overseers. Before long, they would also start dividing themselves into social
classes. ‘Civilization’ came as a package. It meant misery and suf fering for
some (since some would inevitably be reduced to serfs, slaves or debt
peons), but also allowed for the possibility of philosophy , art and the
accumulation of scientiﬁc knowledge.
The evidence no longer suggests anything of the sort. In fact, much of
what we have come to learn in the last forty or ﬁfty years has thrown
conventional wisdom into disarray . In some regions, we now know , cities
governed themselves for centuries without any sign of the temples and
palaces that would only emer ge later; in others, temples and palaces never
emer ged at all. In many early cities, there is simply no evidence of either a
class of administrators or any other sort of ruling stratum. In others,
centralized power seems to appear and then disappear . It would seem that
the mere fact of urban life does not, necessarily , imply any particular form
of political or ganization, and never did.This has all sorts of important implications: for one thing, it suggests a
much less pessimistic assessment of human possibilities, since the mere fact
that much of the world’ s population now live in cities may not determine
how we live, to anything like the extent you might assume – but before even
starting to think about that, we need to ask how we got things so
extraordinarily wrong to begin with.
IN WHICH WE FIRST T AKE ON THE NOT ORIOUS ISSUE OF
‘SCALE’
‘Common sense’ is a peculiar expression. Sometimes it means exactly what
it seems to mean: practical wisdom born of real-life experience, avoiding
stupid, obvious pitfalls. This is what we mean when we say that a cartoon
villain who puts a clearly marked ‘self-destruct’ button on his doomsday
device, or who fails to block the ventilation passages in his secret
headquarters, is lacking common sense. On the other hand, it occasionally
turns out that things which seem like simple common sense are, in fact, not.
For a long time, it was considered almost universal common sense that
women make poor soldiers. After all, it was noted, women tend to be
smaller and have less upper -body strength. Then various military forces
made the experiment and discovered that women also tend to be much
better shots. Similarly , it is almost universal common sense that it’ s
relatively easy for a small group to treat each other as equals and come to
decisions democratically , but that the lar ger the number of people involved,
the more difﬁcult this becomes. If you think about it, this isn’ t really as
commonsensical as it seems, since it clearly isn’ t true of groups that endure.
Over time, any group of intimate friends, let alone a family , will eventually
develop a complicated history that makes coming to agreement on almost
anything difﬁcult; whereas the lar ger the group, the less likely it is to
contain a signiﬁcant proportion of people you speciﬁcally detest. But for
various reasons, the problem of scale has now become a matter of simple
common sense not only to scholars, but to almost everyone else.
Since the problem is typically seen as a result of our evolutionary
inheritance, it might be helpful for a moment to return to the source and
consider how evolutionary psychologists like Robin Dunbar have typically
framed the question. Most begin by observing that the social or ganization of
hunter -gatherers – both ancient and modern – operates at dif ferent tiers orlevels, ‘nested’ inside one another like Russian dolls. The most basic social
unit is the pair -bonded family , with shared investment in of fspring. T o
provide for themselves and dependants, these nuclear units are obliged (or
so the ar gument goes) to cluster together in ‘bands’ made up of ﬁve or six
closely related families. On ritual occasions, or when game is particularly
abundant, such bands coalesce to form ‘residential groups’ (or ‘clans’) of
roughly 150 persons, which – according to Dunbar – is also around the
upper limit of stable, trusting relationships we are cognitively able to keep
track of in our heads. And this, he suggests, is no coincidence. Beyond 150
(which has come to be known as ‘Dunbar ’s Number ’) lar ger groups such as
‘tribes’ may form – but, Dunbar asserts, these lar ger groups will inevitably
lack the solidarity of smaller , kin-based ones, and so conﬂicts will tend to
arise within them.2
Dunbar considers such ‘nested’ arrangements to be among the factors
which shaped human cognition in deep evolutionary time, such that even
today a whole plethora of institutions that require high levels of social
commitment, from military brigades to church congregations, still tend to
gravitate around the original ﬁgure of 150 relationships. It’ s a fascinating
hypothesis. As formulated by evolutionary psychologists, it hinges on the
idea that living hunter -gatherers do actually provide evidence for this
supposedly ancient way of scaling social relationships upwards from core
family units to bands and residential groups, with each lar ger group
reproducing that same sense of loyalty to one’ s natal kin, just on a greater
scale, all the way up to things like ‘brothers’ – or indeed ‘sisters’ – in arms.
But here comes the worm in the bud.
There is an obvious objection to evolutionary models which assume that
our strongest social ties are based on close biological kinship: many humans
just don’ t like their families very much. And this appears to be just as true
of present-day hunter -gatherers as anybody else. Many seem to ﬁnd the
prospect of living their entire lives surrounded by close relatives so
unpleasant that they will travel very long distances just to get away from
them. New work on the demography of modern hunter -gatherers – drawing
statistical comparisons from a global sample of cases, ranging from the
Hadza in T anzania to the Australian Martu3 – shows that residential groups
turn out not to be made up of biological kin at all; and the bur geoning ﬁeld
of human genomics is beginning to suggest a similar picture for ancient
hunter -gatherers as well, all the way back to the Pleistocene.4While modern Martu, for instance, might speak of themselves as if they
were all descended from some common totemic ancestor , it turns out that
primary biological kin actually make up less than 10 per cent of the total
membership of any given residential group. Most participants are drawn
from a much wider pool who do not share close genetic relationships,
whose origins are scattered over very lar ge territories, and who may not
even have grown up speaking the same languages. Anyone recognized to be
Martu is a potential member of any Martu band, and the same turns out to
be true of the Hadza, BaY aka, !Kung San, and so on. The truly adventurous,
meanwhile, can often contrive to abandon their own lar ger group entirely .
This is all the more surprising in places like Australia, where there tend to
be very elaborate kinship systems in which almost all social arrangements
are ostensibly or ganized around genealogical descent from totemic
ancestors.
It would seem, then, that kinship in such cases is really a kind of
metaphor for social attachments, in much the same way we’d say ‘all men
are brothers’ when trying to express internationalism (even if we can’ t stand
our actual brother and haven’ t spoken to him for years). What’ s more, the
shared metaphor often extended over very long distances, as we’ve seen
with the way that T urtle or Bear clans once existed across North America,
or moiety systems across Australia. This made it a relatively simple matter
for anyone disenchanted with their immediate biological kin to travel very
long distances and still ﬁnd a welcome.
It is as though modern forager societies exist simultaneously at two
radically dif ferent scales: one small and intimate, the other spanning vast
territories, even continents. This might seem odd, but from the perspective
of cognitive science it makes perfect sense. It’ s precisely this capacity to
shift between scales that most obviously separates human social cognition
from that of other primates.5 Apes may vie for af fection or dominance, but
any victory is temporary and open to being renegotiated. Nothing is
imagined as eternal. Nothing is really imagined at all. Humans tend to live
simultaneously with the 150-odd people they know personally , and inside
imaginary structures shared by perhaps millions or even billions of other
humans. Sometimes, as in the case of modern nations, these are imagined as
being based on kin ties; sometimes they are not.6
In this, at least, modern foragers are no dif ferent from modern city
dwellers or ancient hunter -gatherers. W e all have the capacity to feel boundto people we will probably never meet; to take part in a macro-society
which exists most of the time as ‘virtual reality’, a world of possible
relationships with its own rules, roles and structures that are held in the
mind and recalled through the cognitive work of image-making and ritual.
Foragers may sometimes exist in small groups, but they do not – and
probably have not ever – lived in small-scale societies .7
None of which is to say that scale – in the sense of absolute population
size – makes no dif ference at all. What it means is that these things do not
necessarily matter in the seemingly common-sense sort of way we tend to
assume. On this particular point, at least, Canetti had it right. Mass society
exists in the mind before it becomes physical reality . And crucially , it also
exists in the mind after  it becomes physical reality .
At this point we can return to cities.
Cities are tangible things. Certain elements of their physical infrastructure –
walls, roads, parks, sewers – might remain ﬁxed for hundreds or even
thousands of years; but in human terms they are never stable. People are
constantly moving in and out of them, whether permanently , or seasonally
for holidays and festivals, to visit relatives, trade, raid, tour around, and so
on; or just in the course of their daily rounds. Y et cities have a life that
transcends all this. This is not because of the permanence of stone or brick
or adobe; neither is it because most people in a city actually meet one
another . It is because they will often think and act as people who belong  to
the city – as Londoners or Muscovites or Calcuttans. As the urban
sociologist Claude Fischer put it:
Most city dwellers lead sensible, circumscribed lives, rarely go
downtown, hardly know areas of the city they neither live nor work
in, and see (in any sociologically meaningful way) only a tiny
fraction of the city’ s population. Certainly , they may on occasion –
during rush hours, football games, etc. – be in the presence of
thousands of strangers, but that does not necessarily have any direct
effect on their personal lives … urbanites live in small social worlds
that touch but do not interpenetrate.8
All this applies in equal measure to ancient cities. Aristotle, for example,
insisted that Babylon was so lar ge that, two or three days after it had beencaptured by a foreign army , some parts of the city still hadn’ t heard the
news. In other words, from the perspective of someone living in an ancient
city, the city itself was not so entirely dif ferent from earlier landscapes of
clans or moieties that extended across hundreds of miles. It was a structure
raised primarily in the human imagination, which allowed for the possibility
of amicable relations with people they had never met.
In Chapter Four  we suggested that for much of human history , the
geographical range in which most human beings were operating was
actually shrinking. Palaeolithic ‘culture areas’ spanned continents.
Mesolithic and Neolithic culture zones still covered much wider areas than
the home territory of most contemporary ethno-linguistic groups (what
anthropologists refer to as ‘cultures’). Cities were part of that process of
contraction, since urbanites could, and many did, spend almost their entire
lives within a few miles’ radius – something that would hardly have been
conceivable for people of an earlier age. One way to think about this would
be to imagine a vast regional system, of the kind that once spanned much of
Australia or North America, being squeezed into a single urban space –
while still maintaining its virtual quality . If that is even roughly what
happened when the earliest cities formed, then there’ s no reason to assume
there were any special cognitive challenges involved. Living in unbounded,
eternal, lar gely imaginary groups is ef fectively what humans had been
doing all along.
So what was really new here? Let’ s go back to the archaeological
evidence. Settlements inhabited by tens of thousands of people make their
ﬁrst appearance in human history around 6000 years ago, on almost every
continent, at ﬁrst in isolation. Then they multiply . One of the things that
makes it so difﬁcult to ﬁt what we now know about them into an old-
fashioned evolutionary sequence, where cities, states, bureaucracies and
social classes all emer ge together ,9 is just how dif ferent these cities are. It’ s
not just that some early cities lack class divisions, wealth monopolies, or
hierarchies of administration. They exhibit such extreme variability as to
imply , from the very beginning, a conscious experimentation in urban form.
Contemporary archaeology shows, among other things, that surprisingly
few of these early cities contain signs of authoritarian rule. It also shows
that their ecology was far more diverse than once believed: cities do not
necessarily depend on a rural hinterland in which serfs or peasants engage
in back-breaking labour , hauling in cartloads of grain for consumption byurban dwellers. Certainly , that situation became increasingly typical in later
ages, but in the ﬁrst cities small-scale gardening and animal-keeping were
often at least as important; so too were the resources of rivers and seas, and
for that matter the continued hunting and collecting of wild seasonal foods
in forests or in marshes. The particular mix depended lar gely on where in
the world the cities happened to be, but it’ s becoming increasingly apparent
that history’ s ﬁrst city dwellers did not always leave a harsh footprint on the
environment, or on each other .
What were these early cities like to live in?
In what follows we’ll mainly describe what happened in Eurasia, before
moving over to Mesoamerica in the next chapter . Of course, the whole story
could be told from other geographical perspectives (that of sub-Saharan
Africa, for instance, where local trajectories of urban development in the
Middle Niger delta stretch back long before the spread of Islam), but there
is only so much one can cover in a single volume without doing excessive
violence to the subject.10 Each region we consider presents a distinct range
of source material for the archaeologist or historian to sift and weigh. In
most cases, written evidence is either lacking or extremely limited in scope.
(We are still talking here, for the most part, about very early periods of
human history , and cultural traditions very dif ferent from our own.)
We may never be able to reconstruct in any detail the unwritten
constitutions of the world’ s ﬁrst cities, or the upheavals that appear to have
periodically changed them. Still, what evidence does exist is robust enough,
not just to upend the conventional narrative but to open our eyes to
possibilities we would otherwise never have considered. Before looking at
speciﬁc cases, we should at least brieﬂy consider why cities ever appeared
in the ﬁrst place. Did the sort of temporary , seasonal aggregation sites we
discussed in earlier chapters gradually become permanent, year -round
settlements? That would be a gratifyingly simple story . Unfortunately , it
doesn’ t seem to be what happened. The reality is more complex and, as
usual, a good deal more interesting.
IN WHICH WE SET THE SCENE BROADL Y FOR A WORLD OF
CITIES, AND SPECULA TE AS T O WHY THEY FIRST AROSEWherever cities emer ged, they deﬁned a new phase of world history .1 1
Let’s call it the ‘early urban world’, an admittedly bland term for what was
in many ways a strange phase of the human past. Perhaps it is one of the
hardest for us now to grasp, since it was simultaneously so familiar and so
alien. W e will consider the familiar parts ﬁrst.
Almost everywhere, in these early cities, we ﬁnd grand, self-conscious
statements of civic unity , the arrangement of built spaces in harmonious and
often beautiful patterns, clearly reﬂecting some kind of planning at the
municipal scale. Where we do have written sources (ancient Mesopotamia,
for example), we ﬁnd lar ge groups of citizens referring to themselves, not in
the idiom of kinship or ethnic ties, but simply as ‘the people’ of a given city
(or often its ‘sons and daughters’), united by devotion to its founding
ancestors, its gods or heroes, its civic infrastructure and ritual calendar ,
which always involves at least some occasions for popular festivity .12
Civic festivals were moments when the imaginary structures to which
people deferred in their daily lives, but which couldn’ t normally be seen,
temporarily took on tangible, material form.
Where there is evidence to be had, we also ﬁnd dif ferences. People who
lived in cities often came from far away . The great city of T eotihuacan in
the V alley of Mexico was already attracting residents from such distant
areas as Y ucatán and the Gulf Coast in the third or fourth century AD;
migrants settled there in their own neighbourhoods, including a possible
Maya district. Immigrants from across the great ﬂoodplains of the Indus
buried their loved ones in the cemeteries of Harappa. T ypically , ancient
cities divided themselves into quarters, which often developed enduring
rivalries, and this seems to have been true of the very ﬁrst cities. Marked
out by walls, gates or ditches, consolidated neighbourhoods of this sort
were probably not dif ferent in any fundamental respect from their modern
counterparts.13
What makes these cities strange, at least to us, is lar gely what isn’ t there.
This is especially true of technology , whether advanced metallur gy,
intensive agriculture, social technologies like administrative records, or
even the wheel. Any one of these things may , or may not, have been
present, depending where in this early urban world we cast our gaze. Here
it’s worth recalling that in most of the Americas, before the European
invasion, there were neither metal tools nor horses, donkeys, camels or
oxen. All movement of people and things was either by foot, canoe ortravois. But the scale of pre-Columbian capitals like T eotihuacan or
Tenochtitlan dwarfs that of the earliest cities in China and Mesopotamia,
and makes the ‘city-states’ of Bronze Age Greece (like T iryns and
Mycenae) seem little more than fortiﬁed hamlets.
In point of fact, the lar gest early cities, those with the greatest
populations, did not appear in Eurasia – with its many technical and
logistical advantages – but in Mesoamerica, which had no wheeled vehicles
or sailing ships, no animal-powered traction or transport, and much less in
the way of metallur gy or literate bureaucracy . This raises an obvious
question: why did so many end up living in the same place to begin with?
The conventional story looks for the ultimate causes in technological
factors: cities were a delayed, but inevitable, ef fect of the ‘Agricultural
Revolution’, which started populations on an upward trajectory and set of f a
chain of other developments, for instance in transport and administration,
which made it possible to support lar ge populations living in one place.
These lar ge populations then required states to administer them. As we’ve
seen, neither part of this story seems to be borne out by the facts.
Indeed, it’ s hard to ﬁnd a single story . Teotihuacan, for instance, appears
to have become such a lar ge city , peaking at perhaps 100,000 souls, mainly
because a series of volcanic eruptions and related natural disasters drove
entire populations out of their homelands to settle there.14 Ecological
factors often played a role in the formation of cities, but in this particular
case these would appear to be only obliquely related to the intensiﬁcation of
agriculture. Still, there are hints of a pattern. Across many parts of Eurasia,
and in a few parts of the Americas, the appearance of cities follows quite
closely on a secondary , post-Ice Age shufﬂing of the ecological pack which
started around 5000 BC. At least two environmental changes were at work
here.
The ﬁrst concerns rivers. At the beginning of the Holocene, the world’ s
great rivers were mostly still wild and unpredictable. Then, around 7,000
years ago, ﬂood regimes started changing, giving way to more settled
routines. This is what created wide and highly fertile ﬂoodplains along the
Yellow River , the Indus, the T igris and other rivers that we associate with
the ﬁrst urban civilizations. Parallel to this, the melting of polar glaciers
slowed down in the Middle Holocene to a point that allowed sea levels the
world over to stabilize, at least to a greater degree than they ever had
before. The combined ef fect of these two processes was dramatic;especially where great rivers met the open waters, depositing their seasonal
loads of fertile silt faster than seawaters could push them back. This was the
origin of those great fan-like deltas we see today at the head of the
Mississippi, the Nile or the Euphrates, for instance.15
Comprising well-watered soils, annually sifted by river action, and rich
wetland and waterside habitats favoured by migratory game and waterfowl,
such deltaic environments were major attractors for human populations.
Neolithic farmers gravitated to them, along with their crops and livestock.
Hardly surprising, considering these were ef fectively scaled-up versions of
the kind of river , spring and lakeside environments in which Neolithic
horticulture ﬁrst began, but with one other major dif ference: just over the
horizon lay the open sea, and before it expansive marshlands supplying
aquatic resources to buf fer the risks of farming, as well as a perennial
source of or ganic materials (reeds, ﬁbres, silt) to support construction and
manufacturing.16
All this, combined with the fertility of alluvial soils further inland,
promoted the growth of more specialized forms of farming in Eurasia,
including the use of animal-drawn ploughs (also adopted in Egypt by 3000
BC), and the breeding of sheep for wool. Extensive agriculture may thus
have been an outcome, not a cause, of urbanization.17 Choices about which
crops and animals to farm often had less to do with brute subsistence than
the bur geoning industries of early cities, notably textile production, as well
as popular forms of urban cuisine such as alcoholic drinks, leavened bread
and dairy products. Hunters and foragers, ﬁshers and fowlers were no less
important to these new urban economies than farmers and shepherds.18
Peasantries, on the other hand, were a later , secondary development.
Wetlands and ﬂoodplains are no friends to archaeological survival. Often,
these earliest phases of urban occupation lie beneath later deposits of silt, or
the remains of cities grown over them. In many parts of the world, the ﬁrst
available evidence relates to an already mature phase of urban expansion:
by the time the picture comes into focus, we already see a marsh
metropolis, or network of centres, out-scaling all previous known
settlements by a factor of ten to one. Some of these cities in former
wetlands have only emer ged very recently into historical view – vir gin
births from the bulrushes. The results are often striking, and their
implications still unclear .We now know , for instance, that in China’ s Shandong province, on the
lower reaches of the Y ellow River , settlements of 300 hectares or more –
such as Liangchengzhen and Y aowangcheng – were present by no later than
2500 BC, which is over 1,000 years before the earliest royal dynasties
developed on the Central Chinese plains. On the other side of the Paciﬁc,
around the same time, ceremonial centres of great magnitude developed in
the valley of Peru’ s Rio Supe, notably at the site of Caral, where
archaeologists have uncovered sunken plazas and monumental platforms
four millennia older than the Inca Empire.19 The extent of human
habitation around these great centres is still to be determined.
These new ﬁndings show that archaeologists still have much to ﬁnd out
about the distribution of the world’ s ﬁrst cities. They also indicate how
much older those cities may be than the systems of authoritarian
government and literate administration that were once assumed necessary
for their foundation. Similar revelations are emer ging from the Maya
lowlands, where ceremonial centres of truly enormous size – and, so far ,
presenting no evidence of monarchy or stratiﬁcation – can now be dated
back as far as 1000 BC: more than 1,000 years before the rise of Classic
Maya kings, whose royal cities were notably smaller in scale.20 This, in
turn, raises a fascinating but difﬁcult question. What held the earliest
experiments in urbanization together , other than reeds, ﬁbres and clay?
What was their social glue? It is high time for some examples but, before
we examine the great valley civilizations of the T igris, Indus and Y ellow
Rivers, we will ﬁrst visit the interior grasslands of eastern Europe.
ON ‘MEGA-SITES’, AND HOW ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDINGS
IN UKRAINE ARE OVER TURNING CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
ON THE ORIGINS OF CITIES
The remote history of the countries around the Black Sea is awash with
gold. At least, any casual visitor to the major museums of Soﬁa, Kiev or
Tbilisi could be for given for leaving with this impression. Ever since the
days of Herodotus, outsiders to the region have come home full of lurid
tales about the lavish funerals of warrior -kings, and the mass slaughter of
horses and retainers that accompanied them. Over 1,000 years later , in the
tenth century AD, the traveller Ibn Fadlan was telling almost identical stories
to impress and titillate his Arab readers.As a result, in these lands the term ‘prehistory’ (or sometimes ‘proto-
history’) has always evoked the legacy of aristocratic tribes and lavish
tombs crammed with treasure. Such tombs are, certainly , there to be found.
On the region’ s western ﬂank, in Bulgaria, they begin with the gold-soaked
cemetery of V arna, oddly placed in what regional archaeologists refer to as
the Copper Age, corresponding to the ﬁfth millennium BC. To the east, in
southernmost Russia, a tradition of extravagant funeral rites began shortly
after, associated with burial mounds known as kurgans , which do indeed
mark the resting places of warrior princes of one sort or another .21
But it turns out this wasn’ t the whole story . In fact, magniﬁcent warrior
tombs might not even be the most interesting aspect of the region’ s
prehistory . There were also cities. Archaeologists in Ukraine and Moldova
got their ﬁrst inkling of them in the 1970s, when they began to detect the
existence of human settlements older and much lar ger than anything they
had previously encountered.22 Further research showed that these
settlements, often referred to as ‘mega-sites’ – with their modern names of
Taljanky , Maidenetske, Nebelivka and so on – dated to the early and middle
centuries of the fourth millennium BC, which meant that some existed even
before the earliest known cities in Mesopotamia. They were also lar ger in
area.
Yet, even now , in scholarly discussions about the origins of urbanism,
these Ukrainian sites almost never come up. Indeed, the very use of the
term ‘mega-site’ is a kind of euphemism, signalling to a wider audience that
these should not be thought of as proper cities but as something more like
villages that for some reason had expanded inordinately in size. Some
archaeologists even refer to them outright as ‘over grown villages’. How do
we account for this reluctance to welcome the Ukrainian mega-sites into the
charmed circle of urban origins? Why has anyone with even a passing
interest in the origin of cities heard of Uruk or Mohenjo-daro, but almost no
one of T aljanky?
The answer is lar gely political. Some of it concerns simple geopolitics:
much of the initial work of discovery was carried out by Eastern Bloc
scholars during the Cold W ar, which not only slowed down the reception of
their ﬁndings in W estern academic circles but tended to tinge any news of
surprising discoveries with at least a tiny bit of scepticism. Even more,
perhaps, it had to do with the internal political life of the prehistoric
settlements themselves. That is, according to conventional views of politics,there didn’ t seem to be any . No evidence was unearthed of centralized
government or administration – or indeed, any form of ruling class. In other
words, these enormous settlements had all the hallmarks of what
evolutionists would call a ‘simple’, not a ‘complex’ society .
It’s hard here not to recall Ursula Le Guin’ s famous short story ‘The
Ones Who W alk A way from Omelas’, about the imaginary city of Omelas,
a city which also made do without kings, wars, slaves or secret police. W e
have a tendency , Le Guin notes, to write of f such a community as ‘simple’,
but in fact these citizens of Omelas were ‘not simple folk, not dulcet
shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians. They were not less complex than
us.’ The trouble is just that ‘we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants
and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid.’
Le Guin has a point. Obviously , we have no idea how relatively happy
the inhabitants of Ukrainian mega-sites like Maidenetske or Nebelivka
were, compared to the lords who constructed kurgan burials, or even the
retainers ritually sacriﬁced at their funerals; or the bonded labourers who
provided wheat and barley to the inhabitants of later Greek colonies along
the Black Sea coast (though we can guess), and as anyone who has read the
story knows, Omelas had some problems too. But the point remains: why
do we assume that people who have ﬁgured out a way for a lar ge population
to govern and support itself without temples, palaces and military
fortiﬁcations – that is, without overt displays of arrogance, self-abasement
and cruelty – are somehow less complex than those who have not?
Why would we hesitate to dignify such a place with the name of ‘city’?
The mega-sites of Ukraine and adjoining regions were inhabited from
roughly 4100 to 3300 BC, that is, for something in the order of eight
centuries, which is considerably longer than most subsequent urban
traditions. Why were they there at all? Like the cities of Mesopotamia and
the Indus valley , they appear to have been born of ecological opportunism
in the middle phase of the Holocene. Not ﬂoodplain dynamics, in this case,
but processes of soil formation on the ﬂatlands north of the Black Sea.
These black earths (Russian: chernozem ) are legendary for their fertility; for
the empires of later antiquity , they made the lands between the Southern
Bug and Dniepr Rivers a breadbasket (which is why Greek city-states
established colonies in the region and enslaved or made serfs of the local
populations to begin with: ancient Athens was lar gely fed by Black Sea
grain).By 4500 BC, chernozem  was widely distributed between the Carpathian
and the Ural Mountains, where a mosaic landscape of open prairie and
woodland emer ged capable of supporting dense human habitation.23 The
Neolithic people who settled there had travelled east from the lower reaches
of the Danube, passing through the Carpathian Mountains. W e do not know
why, but we do know that – throughout their peregrinations in river valleys
and mountain passes – they retained a cohesive social identity . Their
villages, often small in scale, shared similar cultural practices, reﬂected in
the forms taken by their dwellings, female ﬁgurines and ways of making
and serving food. The archaeological name given to this particular ‘design
for life’ is the Cucuteni-T ripolye culture, after the sites where it was ﬁrst
recorded.24
So the Ukrainian and Moldovan mega-sites did not come out of thin air .
They were the physical realization of an extended community that already
existed long before its constituent units coalesced into lar ge settlements.
Some tens of these settlements have now been documented. The biggest
currently known – T aljanky – extends over an area of 300 hectares,
outspanning the earliest phases of the city of Uruk in southern
Mesopotamia. It presents no evidence of central administration or
communal storage facilities. Nor have any government buildings,
fortiﬁcations or monumental architecture been found. There is no acropolis
or civic centre; no equivalent to Uruk’ s raised public district called Eanna
(‘House of Heaven’) or the Great Bath of Mohenjo-daro.
What we do ﬁnd are houses; well over 1,000 in the case of T aljanky .
Rectangular houses, sixteen or so feet wide and twice as long, built of
wattle and daub on timber frames, with stone foundations. W ith their
attached gardens, these houses form such neat circular patterns that from a
bird’ s-eye view , any mega-site resembles the inside of a tree trunk: great
rings, with concentric spaces between. The innermost ring frames a big gap
in the middle of the settlement, where early excavators at ﬁrst expected to
ﬁnd something dramatic, whether magniﬁcent buildings or grand burials.
But in every known case, the central area is simply empty; guesses for its
function range from popular assemblies to ceremonies or the seasonal
penning of animals – or possibly all three.25 In consequence, the standard
archaeological plan of a Ukrainian mega-site is all ﬂesh, no core.
Just as surprising as their scale is the distribution of these massive
settlements, which are all quite close to each other , at most six to nine milesapart.26 Their total population – estimated in the many thousands per
mega-site, and probably well over 10,000 in some cases – would therefore
have had to draw resources from a common hinterland. Y et their ecological
footprint appears to have been surprisingly light.27 There are a number of
possible explanations. Some have suggested the mega-sites were only
occupied part of the year , even for just a season,28 making them urban-
scale versions of the kind of temporary aggregation sites we discussed in
Chapter Three . This is difﬁcult to reconcile with the substantial nature of
their houses (consider the ef fort expended in felling trees, laying
foundations, making good walls etc.). More probably , the mega-sites were
much like most other cities, neither permanently inhabited nor strictly
seasonal, but somewhere in between.29We should also consider if the inhabitants of the mega-sites consciously
managed their ecosystem to avoid lar ge-scale deforestation. This is
consistent with archaeological studies of their economy , which suggest a
pattern of small-scale gardening, often taking place within the bounds of the
settlement, combined with the keeping of livestock, cultivation of orchards,
and a wide spectrum of hunting and foraging activities. The diversity is
actually remarkable, as is its sustainability . As well as wheat, barley and
pulses, the citizens’ plant diet included apples, pears, cherries, sloes, acorns,
hazelnuts and apricots. Mega-site dwellers were hunters of red deer , roe
deer and wild boar as well as farmers and foresters. It was ‘play farming’ on
a grand scale: an urban populus supporting itself through small-scale
cultivation and herding, combined with an extraordinary array of wild
foods.30
This way of life was by no means ‘simple’. As well as managing
orchards, gardens, livestock and woodlands, the inhabitants of these cities
imported salt in bulk from springs in the eastern Carpathians and the Black
Sea littoral. Flint extraction by the ton took place in the Dniestr valley ,
furnishing material for tools. A household potting industry ﬂourished, its
products considered among the ﬁnest ceramics of the prehistoric world; and
regular supplies of copper ﬂowed in from the Balkans.31 There is no ﬁrm
consensus among archaeologists about what sort of social arrangements all
this required, but most would agree the logistical challenges were daunting.
A surplus was deﬁnitely produced, and with it ample potential for some to
seize control of the stocks and supplies, to lord it over others or battle for
the spoils; but over eight centuries we ﬁnd little evidence for warfare or the
rise of social elites. The true complexity of the mega-sites lies in the
strategies they adopted to prevent such things.
How did it all work? In the absence of written records (or a time machine),
there are serious limits to what we can say about kinship and inheritance, or
how people in these cities went about making collective decisions.32 Still,
some clues exist, beginning at the level of individual households. Each of
these had a roughly common plan, but each was also, in its own way ,unique. From one dwelling to the next there is constant innovation, even
playfulness, in the rules of commensality . Each family unit invented its own
slight variations on domestic rituals, reﬂected in its unique assemblage of
serving and eating vessels, painted with polychrome designs of often
mesmerizing intensity and made in a dazzling variety of forms. It’ s as if
every household was an artists’ collective which invented its own unique
aesthetic style.
Some of this household pottery evokes the bodies of women; and among
the other items most commonly found within the remains of houses are
female ﬁgurines of clay . Model houses and tiny replicas of furniture and
eating equipment also survive – miniature representations of lost social
worlds, again, afﬁrming the prominent role of women within them.33 All
this tells us a little about the cultural atmosphere of these households (and
one can easily see why Marija Gimbutas, whose syntheses of Eurasian
prehistory we discussed earlier , considered the Cucuteni-T ripolye culture to
be part of ‘Old Europe’, with its cultural roots in the early farming societies
of Anatolia and the Middle East). But how did these households come
together in such numbers to form the great concentric arrangements which
give the Ukrainian mega-sites their distinctive plan?
The ﬁrst impression of these sites is one of rigid uniformity , a closed
circuit of social interaction, but closer study reveals constant deviation from
the norm. Individual households would sometimes opt to cluster together in
groups of between three and ten families. Ditches or pits marked their
boundaries. At some sites these groups coalesce into neighbourhoods,
radiating out from the centre to the perimeter of the city , and even forming
larger residential districts or quarters. Each had access to at least one
assembly house, a structure lar ger than an ordinary dwelling where a wider
sector of the population might gather periodically for activities we can only
guess at (political meetings? legal proceedings? seasonal festivities?).34
Careful analysis by archaeologists shows how the apparent uniformity of
the Ukrainian mega-sites arose from the bottom up, through processes of
local decision-making.35 This would have to mean that members of
individual households – or at least, their neighbourhood representatives –
shared a conceptual framework for the settlement as a whole. W e can also
safely infer that this framework was based on the image of a circle and its
properties of transformation. T o understand how the citizens put this mental
image into ef fect, translating it into a workable social reality at suchenormous scales, we cannot rely on archaeology alone. Fortunately , the
burgeoning ﬁeld of ethno-mathematics shows exactly how such a system
might have worked in practice. The most informative case we know of is
that of traditional Basque settlements in the highlands of the Pyrénées-
Atlantiques.
These modern Basque societies – tucked down in the southwest corner of
France – also imagine their communities in circular form, just as they
imagine themselves as being surrounded by a circle of mountains. They do
so as a way of emphasizing the ideal equality of households and family
units. Now , obviously , the social arrangements of these existing
communities are unlikely to be quite the same as those of ancient Ukraine.
Nonetheless, they provide an excellent illustration of how such circular
arrangements can form part of self-conscious egalitarian projects, in which
‘everyone has neighbours to the left and neighbours to the right. No one is
ﬁrst, and no one is last.’36
In the commune of Sainte-Engrâce, for instance, the circular template of
the village is also a dynamic model used as a counting device, to ensure the
seasonal rotation of essential tasks and duties. Each Sunday , one household
will bless two loaves at the local church, eat one, then present the other to
its ‘ﬁrst neighbour ’ (the house to their right); the next week that neighbour
will do the same to the next house to its right, and so on in a clockwise
direction, so that in a community of 100 households it would take about two
years to complete a full cycle.37
As so often with such matters, there is an entire cosmology , a theory of
the human condition, baked in, as it were: the loaves are spoken of as
‘semen’, as something that gives life; meanwhile, care for the dead and
dying travels in the opposite, counter -clockwise direction. But the system is
also the basis for economic co-operation. If any one household is for any
reason unable to fulﬁl its obligations when it is time to do so, a careful
system of substitution comes into play , so neighbours at ﬁrst, second and
sometimes third remove can temporarily take their place. This in turn
provides the model for virtually all forms of co-operation. The same system
of ‘ﬁrst neighbours’ and substitution, the same serial model of reciprocity ,
is used to call up anything that requires more hands than a single family can
provide: from planting and harvesting to cheese-making and slaughtering
pigs. It follows that households cannot simply schedule their daily labour in
line with their own needs. They also have to consider their obligations toother households, which in turn have their own obligations to other ,
different households, and so on. Factoring in that some tasks – such as
moving ﬂocks to highland pastures, or the demands of milking, shearing
and guarding herds – may require the combined ef forts of ten dif ferent
households, and that households have to balance the scheduling of
numerous dif ferent sorts of commitment, we begin to get a sense of the
complexities involved.
In other words, such ‘simple’ economies are rarely all that simple. They
often involve logistical challenges of striking complexity , resolved on a
basis of intricate systems of mutual aid, all without any need of centralized
control or administration. Basque villagers in this region are self-conscious
egalitarians, in the sense that they insist each household is ultimately the
same and has the same responsibilities as any others; yet rather than
governing themselves through communal assemblies (which earlier
generations of Basque townsfolk famously created in places like Guernica),
they rely on mathematical principles such as rotation, serial replacement
and alternation. But the end result is the same, and the system ﬂexible
enough that changes in the number of households or the capacities of their
individual members can be continually taken into account, ensuring
relations of equality are preserved over the long term, with an almost
complete absence of internal conﬂict.
There is no reason to assume that such a system would only work on a
small scale: a village of 100 households is already way beyond Dunbar ’s
proposed cognitive threshold of 150 people (the number of stable, trusting
relationships we are able to keep track of in our minds, before – according,
that is, to Dunbar – we are obliged to start putting chiefs and administrators
in char ge of social af fairs); and Basque villages and towns used to be far
larger than this. One can at least begin to see how – in a dif ferent context –
such egalitarian systems might scale up to communities of many hundreds
or even thousands of households. Returning to the Ukrainian mega-sites, we
must admit that much remains unknown. Around the middle of the fourth
millennium BC, most of them were basically abandoned. W e still don’ t
know why . What they of fer us, in the meantime, is signiﬁcant: proof that
highly egalitarian or ganization has been possible on an urban scale.38 With
this in mind, we can look with fresh eyes at some better -known cases from
other parts of Eurasia. Let’ s start with Mesopotamia.ON MESOPOT AMIA, AND ‘NOT -SO-PRIMITIVE’ DEMOCRACY
‘Mesopotamia’ means ‘land between the two rivers’. Archaeologists
sometimes also call this region the ‘heartland of cities’.39 Its ﬂoodplains
cross the otherwise arid landscape of southern Iraq, turning to marshland as
they near the head of the Persian Gulf.40 Urban life here goes back at least
to 3500 BC. In the more northerly lands between the T igris and Euphrates,
where the rivers ﬂow through rain-fed plains, the history of cities may go
even further back, beyond 4000 BC.41
Unlike the Ukrainian mega-sites, or the Bronze Age cities of the Indus
valley to which we’ll turn shortly , Mesopotamia was already part of modern
memory before any archaeologist put a spade into one of its ancient
mounds.42 Anyone who had read the Bible knew about the kingdoms of
Babylonia and Assyria; and in the V ictorian era of high empire, biblical
scholars and Orientalists began excavating sites with scriptural associations,
like Nineveh and Nimrud, hoping to uncover cities ruled by ﬁgures of
legend such as Nebuchadnezzar , Sennacherib or T iglath-Pileser . They did
ﬁnd these; but in those places and elsewhere they discovered other things
that were even more spectacular , like a basalt stela bearing the law code of
Hammurabi, ruler of Babylon in the eighteenth century BC, unearthed at
Susa in western Iran; clay tablets from Nineveh bearing copies of the Epic
of Gilgamesh , fabled ruler of Uruk; and the Royal T ombs of Ur in southern
Iraq, where kings and queens unknown to the Bible were interred with
startling riches and the remains of sacriﬁced retainers around 2500 BC.
There were even bigger surprises. The oldest remains of cities and
kingdoms – including the Royal T ombs of Ur – belonged to a culture
previously unknown, and not mentioned in scripture: the Sumerians, who
used a language unrelated to the Semitic family from which Hebrew and
Arabic derive.43 (In fact, as in the case of Basque, there’ s no consensus on
what language family Sumerian does belong to.) But in general, the ﬁrst
decades of archaeological work in the region, from the late nineteenth to the
early twentieth century , conﬁrmed an expected association of ancient
Mesopotamia with empire and monarchy . The Sumerians, at least on ﬁrst
sighting, seemed no exception.44 In fact, they set the tone. Such was public
interest in the ﬁndings from Ur that in the 1920s the Illustrated London
News  (England’ s ‘window on the world’) devoted no less than thirty feature
articles to Leonard W oolley’ s excavation of the Royal T ombs.All this reinforced a popular picture of Mesopotamia as a civilization of
cities, monarchy and aristocracy , all tinged with the excitement of
uncovering the ‘truth’ behind biblical scripture (‘Ur of the Chaldees,’ as
well as being a Sumerian city , appears in the Hebrew Bible as the birthplace
of the patriarch Abraham). But one of the major accomplishments of
modern archaeology and epigraphy has been to redraw this picture entirely:
to show that Mesopotamia was never , in fact, an eternal ‘land of kings’. The
real story is far more complicated.
The earliest Mesopotamian cities – those of the fourth and early third
millennia BC – present no clear evidence for monarchy at all. Now , you
might object, it’ s difﬁcult to prove for certain that something isn’t there.
However , we know what evidence for monarchy in such cities would be
like, because half a millennium later (from around 2800 BC onwards)
monarchy starts popping up everywhere: palaces, aristocratic burials and
royal inscriptions, along with defensive walls for cities and or ganized
militia to guard them. But the birth of cities, and with it the basic elements
of Mesopotamian civic life – the ancient building blocks of its urban society
– begin considerably before this ‘Early Dynastic’ period.
These original urban elements include some which have been wrongly
characterized as inventions of royal statecraft, such as the institution that
historians call by the French term corvée. This refers to obligatory labour
on civic projects exacted from free citizens on a seasonal basis, and it has
always been assumed to be a form of tax extracted by powerful rulers: taxes
paid not in goods, but in services. From a Mesopotamian perspective,
though, corvée was already very ancient. As old as humanity itself. The
ﬂood-myth Atrahasis  – the prototype for the Old T estament story of Noah –
tells how the gods ﬁrst created people to perform corvée on their behalf.
Mesopotamian gods were unusually hands-on, and had originally worked
themselves. Eventually tiring of digging irrigation canals, they created
minor deities to do the work, but they too rebelled, and – receiving a much
more favourable hearing than Lucifer would in Heaven – the gods conceded
to their demands and created people.45
Everyone had to do corvée. Even the most powerful Mesopotamian rulers
of later periods had to heave a basket of clay to the construction site of an
important temple. The Sumerian word for corvée ( dubsig ) refers to this
basket of earth, written with a pictogram showing a person lifting it on totheir head, like kings do on monuments such as the Plaque of Ur -Nanshe,
carved around 2500 BC. Free citizens performed dubsig  for weeks or even
months. When they did, high-ranking clerics and administrators worked
alongside artisans, shepherds and cereal farmers. Later kings could grant
exemptions, allowing the rich to pay tax in lieu, or employ others to do the
work for them. Still, all contributed in some way .46
Royal hymns describe the ‘happy faces’ and ‘joyous hearts’ of corvée
workers. No doubt there’ s an element of propaganda here, but it’ s clear that,
even in periods of monarchy and empire, these seasonal projects were
undertaken in a festive spirit, labourers receiving copious rewards of bread,
beer, dates, cheese and meat. There was also something of the carnival
about them. They were occasions when the moral order of the city spun on
its axis, and distinctions between citizens dissolved away . The ‘Hymns of
Gudea’ – the governor ( ensi) of the city-state of Lagash – convey
something of the atmosphere in which they took place. Dating from around
the end of the third millennium BC, they eulogize the restoration of a temple
called Eninnu , the House of Ningirsu, patron deity of the city:
Women did not carry baskets,
only the top warriors did the building
for him; the whip did not strike;
mother did not hit her (disobedient) child;
The general,
The colonel,
The captain,
(and) the conscript,
they (all) shared the work equally;
the supervision indeed was (like)
soft wool in their hands.47
More lasting beneﬁts for the citizenry at lar ge included debt cancellation by
the governor .48 Times of labour mobilization were thus seen as moments of
absolute equality before the gods – when even slaves might be placed on an
equal footing to their masters – as well as times when the imaginary city
became real, as its inhabitants shed their day-to-day identities as bakers or
tavern keepers or inhabitants of such and such a neighbourhood, or later
generals or slaves, and brieﬂy assembled to become ‘the people’ of Lagash,or Kish, Eridu, or Larsa as they built or rebuilt some part of the city or the
network of irrigation canals that sustained it.
If this is at least partly how cities were built, it’ s hard to write such
festivals of f as pure symbolic display . What’ s more, there were other
institutions, also said to originate in the Predynastic age, which ensured that
ordinary citizens had a signiﬁcant hand in government. Even the most
autocratic rulers of later city-states were answerable to a panoply of town
councils, neighbourhood wards and assemblies – in all of which women
often participated alongside men.49 The ‘sons and daughters’ of a city
could make their voices heard, inﬂuencing everything from taxation to
foreign policy . These urban assemblies might not have been so powerful as
those of ancient Greece – but, on the other hand, slavery was not nearly so
developed in Mesopotamia, and women were not excluded from politics to
anything like the same degree.50 In diplomatic correspondence, we also
catch occasional glimpses of corporate bodies rising up against unpopular
rulers or policies, often successfully .
The term used by modern scholars for this general state of af fairs is
‘primitive democracy’. It’ s not a very good term, since there’ s no particular
reason to think any of these institutions were in any way crude or
unsophisticated. Ar guably , the continued use of this odd term by researchers
has inhibited wider discussion, which remains mostly conﬁned to the
specialist ﬁeld of Assyriology: the study of ancient Mesopotamia and its
written legacy in the cuneiform script. Let’ s take a closer look at the
argument, and some of its implications.
The idea that Mesopotamia possessed a ‘primitive democracy’ was ﬁrst
advanced in the 1940s by Thorkild Jacobsen, the Danish historian and
Assyriologist.51 Today , scholars in that ﬁeld have extended his idea even
further . District councils and assemblies of elders – representing the
interests of urban publics – were not just a feature of the earliest
Mesopotamian cities, as Jacobsen thought; there is evidence for them in all
later periods of Mesopotamian history too, right down to the time of the
Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian Empires, whose memory lived on
through biblical scripture.
Popular councils and citizen assemblies (Sumerian: ukkin ; Akkadian:
puhrum ) were stable features of government, not just in Mesopotamian
cities, but also their colonial of fshoots (like the Old Assyrian karum  of
Kanesh, in Anatolia), and in the urban societies of neighbouring peoplessuch as the Hittites, Phoenicians, Philistines and Israelites.52 In fact, it is
almost impossible to ﬁnd a city anywhere in the ancient Near East that did
not have some equivalent to a popular assembly – or often several
assemblies (for instance, dif ferent ones representing the interests of ‘the
young’ and ‘the old’). This was the case even in areas such as the Syrian
steppe and northern Mesopotamia, where traditions of monarchy ran
deep.53 Still, we know very little about how these assemblies functioned,
their composition, or often even where they met.54 Likely as not, an
ancient Greek observer might have described some of them as democratic,
others oligarchic, still others as a mix of democratic, oligarchic and
monarchic principles. But for the most part, experts can only guess.
Some of the clearest evidence comes from between the ninth and seventh
centuries BC. Assyrian emperors like Sennacherib and Ashurbanipal have
been famous since biblical times for their brutality , creating monuments that
boasted of the bloody vengeance they carried out against rebels. But when
dealing with loyal subjects they were strikingly hands-of f, often granting
near-total autonomy to citizen bodies that made decisions collectively .55
We know this because governors stationed far from the Assyrian court, in
southern Mesopotamia’ s major cities – Babylon, Nippur , Uruk, Ur , and so
on – sent letters to their overlords. Many of these were letters recovered by
archaeologists during the excavation of royal archives at the ancient
imperial capital of Nineveh. In them, city governors relay information to the
Assyrian court about decisions made by civic councils. W e learn the ‘will of
the people’ on matters ranging from foreign policy to the election of
governors; also, that citizen bodies sometimes took matters into their own
hands, raising soldiers or taxes to support civic projects, and playing their
overlords of f against each other .
Neighbourhood wards (Akkadian: bābtum , after the word for ‘gate’)
were active in local administration, and sometimes appear to have
replicated certain aspects of village or tribal governance in an urban
setting.56 Murder trials, divorce and property disputes seem to have been
mostly in the hands of town councils. T exts found at Nippur give unusual
details about the composition of one such assembly , summoned to act as a
jury for a homicide case. Among those sitting we ﬁnd one bird catcher , one
potter , two gardeners and a soldier in the service of a temple. The
Trinidadian intellectual C. L. R. James once said of ﬁfth-century Athens
that ‘every cook can govern’. In Mesopotamia, or at least in many parts ofit, it seems this was literally true: being a manual labourer did not exclude
one from direct participation in law and politics.57
Participatory government in ancient Mesopotamian cities was or ganized
at multiple levels, from wards – sometimes deﬁned on ethnic lines or in
terms of professional afﬁliations – up to lar ger urban districts, and
ultimately the city as a whole. The interests of individual citizens might be
represented at every tier , but the surviving written evidence contains
frustratingly few details about how this system of urban government
worked in practice. Historians attribute this lack of information to the key
role of assemblies, operating at various scales, and conducting their
deliberations (about local property disputes, divorce and inheritance cases,
accusations of theft or murder , and so on) in ways that were lar gely
independent of central government and did not require its written
authorization.58
Archaeologists ﬁnd themselves in general agreement with the historians,
although one might reasonably ask how archaeology can shed independent
light on such political matters. One answer comes from the site of
Mashkan-shapir , an important centre under the kings of Larsa, around 2000
BC. As with most Mesopotamian cities, the urban landscape of Mashkan-
shapir was dominated by its main temple – in this case, the sanctuary of
Nergal, god of the underworld – raised up high on a ziggurat platform; but
intensive archaeological survey of the city’ s harbour , gateways and
residential districts revealed a strikingly even distribution of wealth, craft
production and administrative tools across the ﬁve main districts, with no
obvious centre of commercial or political power .59 In terms of day-to-day
affairs, city dwellers (even under monarchies) lar gely governed themselves,
presumably much as they had before kings appeared on the scene to begin
with.
Things could work the other way round. Sometimes, the arrival of an
authoritarian ruler from outside the city sent urban life into reverse. Such
was the case with the Amorite Dynasty of the Lims – Y aggid-Lim,
Yahudun-Lim and Zimri-Lim – which conquered much of the Syrian
Euphrates around the same time Mashkan-shapir was thriving far to the
south. The Lims decided to set up their centre of operations in the ancient
city called Mari (modern T ell Hariri, on the Syrian Euphrates), and
occupied government buildings in its heart. Their arrival seems to have
precipitated a mass exodus of Mari’ s urban population, who left to join upwith smaller townships or tent-dwelling herders scattered across the Syrian
steppe. Before the sack of Mari by Hammurabi of Babylon in 1761 BC, the
last ‘city’ of the Amorite kings comprised little more than the royal
residence, harem, attached temples and a handful of other ofﬁcial
buildings.60
Written correspondence of this period of fers direct evidence of antipathy
between arriviste monarchy of this kind and the established power of urban
assemblies. Letters to Zimri-Lim from T erru – lord of the ancient Hurrian
capital of Urkesh (modern T ell Mozan) – convey his impotence in the face
of the city’ s councils and assemblies. On one occasion, T erru tells Zimri-
Lim: ‘Because I am submitted to my lord’ s pleasure, the inhabitants of my
town despise me, and two and three times I have snatched my head back
from death by their hand.’ T o which the Mari king responds: ‘I did not
realize that the inhabitants of your town despised you on account of me.
You belong to me even if the town of Urkesh belongs to someone else.’ All
this came to a head when T erru confessed he had to ﬂee from public opinion
(‘the mouth of Urkesh’), taking refuge in a nearby town.61
So, far from needing rulers to manage urban life, it seems most
Mesopotamian urbanites were or ganized into autonomous self-governing
units, which might react to of fensive overlords either by driving them out or
by abandoning the city entirely . None of this necessarily answers the
question, ‘what was the nature of government in Mesopotamian cities
befor e the appearance of kingship?’ (though it’ s certainly suggestive).
Instead, the answers depend to a slightly alarming degree on discoveries
from a single site: the city of Uruk – modern W arka, biblical Erech – whose
later mythology inspired Jacobsen’ s original search for ‘primitive
democracy’.62
IN WHICH WE DESCRIBE HOW (WRITTEN) HIST ORY, AND
PROBABL Y (ORAL) EPIC T OO, BEGAN: WITH BIG COUNCILS
IN THE CITIES, AND SMALL KINGDOMS IN THE HILLS
At 3300 BC, Uruk was a city of around 200 hectares, dwarﬁng her
neighbours on the southern Mesopotamian ﬂoodplain. Estimates of Uruk’ s
population at this time range widely , between 20,000 and 50,000. The ﬁrst
residential quarters are built over by later urban settlement, which continued
down to the time of Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC.63Cuneiform script may well have been invented at Uruk, around 3300 BC,
and we can see its early stages of development in numerical tablets and
other forms of administrative notation. Bookkeeping in the city’ s temples
was writing’ s main function at that point.64 Thousands of years later , it was
also in the temples of Uruk that cuneiform script ﬁnally passed into
obsolescence, by which time it had been elaborated to record, among other
things, the world’ s earliest written literature and law codes.
What do we know about the original city of Uruk? By the late fourth
millennium BC it had a high acropolis, much of which was taken up by the
raised public district called Eanna, ‘House of Heaven’, dedicated to the
Goddess Inanna. On its summit stood nine monumental buildings, of which
only the foundations of imported limestone survive, together with bits of
stairwells and fragments of columned halls decorated with coloured mosaic.
The roofs of these broad civic structures must originally have been
constructed of exotic timbers, brought by river bar ge from the ‘Cedar
Forest’ of Syria, which form the backdrop to the Mesopotamian Epic of
Gilgamesh.
For the urban historian, Uruk remains something of a strange fruit. A bit
like a Ukrainian mega-site in reverse, its oldest known architectural layout
is all core with no surrounding ﬂesh, since we know almost nothing of the
residential districts beyond the Eanna precinct, which were ignored by early
excavators at the site. In other words, we glimpse something of the city’ s
public sector , but as yet we have no private sector against which to deﬁne it.
Still, let’ s press on with what we do know .
Most of these public buildings seem to have been great communal
assembly halls, clearly modelled on the plan of ordinary households, but
constructed as houses of the gods.65 There was also a Great Court
comprising an enormous sunken plaza, 165 feet across, entirely surrounded
by two tiers of benches and equipped with water channels to feed trees and
gardens, which of fered much-needed shade for open-air gatherings. This
sort of arrangement – a series of magniﬁcent, open temples accompanied by
a congenial space for public meetings – is exactly what one might expect
were Uruk to have been governed by a popular assembly; and, as Jacobsen
emphasized, the Gilgamesh epic (which begins in Predynastic Uruk) does
speak of such assemblies, including one reserved for the young men of the
city.To draw an obvious parallel: the Athenian agora in the time of Pericles
(the ﬁfth century BC) was also full of public temples, but the actual
democratic assemblies took place in an open space called the Pnyx, a low
hill equipped with seating for the Council of Five Hundred citizens,
appointed – by sortition, with rotating membership – to run the everyday
affairs of the city (all other citizens were expected to stand). Meetings at the
Pnyx could involve anywhere between 6,000 and 12,000 people, groups
comprising free adult males drawn from perhaps 20 per cent of the city’ s
total population. The Great Court at Uruk is considerably lar ger, and while
we have little idea what the total population of Uruk was in, say , 3500 BC,
it’s hard to imagine it was anywhere near that of classical Athens. This
suggests a wider range of participation, which would make sense if women
were not entirely excluded and if early Uruk did not, like later Athens,
deﬁne some 30 per cent of its population as resident aliens with no voting
rights, and up to 40 per cent as slaves.
Much of this remains speculative, but what’ s clear is that in later periods
things change. Around 3200 BC the original public buildings of the Eanna
sanctuary were razed and covered with debris, and its sacred landscape
redesigned around a series of gated courts and ziggurats. By 2900 BC, we
have evidence for local kings of rival city-states battling it out for
supremacy over Uruk, in response to which a ﬁve-and-a-half-mile
fortiﬁcation wall (whose building was later attributed to Gilgamesh) went
up around the city’ s perimeter . Within a few centuries, city rulers were
setting themselves up as neighbours of the goddesses and the gods, building
their own palatial houses on the doorstep to the House of Heaven and
stamping their names into its sacred brickwork.66
Once again, while evidence of democratic self-governance is always a bit
ambiguous (would anyone guess what was really going on in ﬁfth-century
Athens, from archaeological evidence alone?), evidence for royal rule,
when it appears, is entirely unmistakable.
What Uruk is really famous for is writing. It is the ﬁrst city for which we
have extensive written records, and some of these documents do date back
to the period before royal rule. Unfortunately , while they can be read, they
are also extremely difﬁcult to interpret.
Most are cuneiform tablets recovered from trash dumps dug into the
foundations of the acropolis, and they appear to provide only a very narrowwindow on to city life. The great majority are bureaucratic receipts,
recording transactions of goods and services. There are also ‘school texts’
which comprise sign-lists, copied out by scribes in training to familiarize
them with the standard administrative lexicon of the time. The historical
value of the latter is unclear , because scribes may have had to learn to write
all kinds of cuneiform signs – which were executed by pressing a reed
stylus into moist clay – that had little application in practice. Such learning
may well have been part of what was considered a proper literate training at
the time.67
Still, the mere existence of a college of scribes administering complicated
relations between people, animals and things shows us there was much
more going on in the lar ge ‘houses of the gods’ than just ritual gatherings.
There were goods and industries to be administered, and a body of citizens
who developed pedagogical techniques that quickly became so essential to
this particular form of urban life that they remain with us to this day . To get
a sense of how pervasive some of these innovations were, consider that just
about anyone reading this book is likely to have ﬁrst learned to read in
classrooms, sitting in rows opposite a teacher , who follows a standard
curriculum. This rather stern way of learning was itself a Sumerian
invention, one now to be found in virtually every corner of our world.68
So what do we know about these houses of the gods? For one thing, it is
clear that in many ways they resembled factories more than churches. Even
the earliest for which there is evidence had considerable amounts of human
labour at their disposal, along with workshops and stockpiles of raw
materials. Some details of the way these Sumerian temples or ganized
themselves are still with us, including the quantiﬁcation of human labour
into standard workloads and units of time. Sumerian ofﬁcials counted all
sorts of things – including days, months and years – using a sexagesimal
(base-60) system from which ultimately derives (via many and varied
pathways of transmission) our own system of time-reckoning.69 In their
bookkeeping records we ﬁnd the ancient seedbeds of modern industrialism,
ﬁnance and bureaucracy .
It is often hard to determine exactly who these temple labourers were, or
even what sort of people were being or ganized in this way , allotted meals
and having their outputs inventoried – were they permanently attached to
the temple, or just ordinary citizens fulﬁlling their annual corvée duty? –
but the presence of children in the lists suggests at least some may havelived there. If so, then this was most likely because they had nowhere else
to go. If later Sumerian temples are anything to go by , this workforce will
have comprised a whole assortment of the urban needy: widows, orphans
and others rendered vulnerable by debt, crime, conﬂict, poverty , disease or
disability , who found in the temple a place of refuge and support.70
For the time being, though, let us just emphasize the remarkable number
of industries that developed in these temple workshops, as documented in
the cuneiform accounts. Among them we ﬁnd the ﬁrst lar ge-scale dairy and
wool production; also the manufacture of leavened bread, beer and wine,
including facilities for standardized packaging. Some eighty varieties of ﬁsh
– fresh- and saltwater – appear in the administrative accounts along with
their associated oil and food products, preserved and stored in temple
repositories. From this we can deduce that a primary economic function of
this temple sector was to co-ordinate labour at key times of year , and to
provide quality control for processed goods that dif fered from those made
in ordinary households.71
This particular kind of work, unlike the maintenance of irrigation dykes
and building of roads and embankments, was routinely carried out under
central administrative control. In other words, in the early phases of
Mesopotamian urban life, what we would ordinarily imagine as the state
sector (e.g. public works, international relations) was managed lar gely by
local or city-wide assemblies; while top-down bureaucratic procedures were
limited to what we would now think of as the economic or commodity
sphere.72
Of course, Uruk’ s inhabitants didn’ t have an explicit concept of ‘the
economy’ – no one did until very recent times. For Sumerians, the ultimate
purpose of all these factories and workshops was to provide the gods and
goddesses of the city with an illustrious residence where they would receive
offerings of food, ﬁne clothing and care, which also meant servicing their
cult and or ganizing their festivals. The latter activity was probably depicted
on the Uruk V ase, one of the few surviving examples of narrative art from
this early period, whose carved decoration shows a number of identical
nude males parading behind one lar ger male ﬁgure to the temple precinct of
the Goddess Inanna with their yield of ﬁeld, orchard and ﬂock.73
It’s not entirely clear who the lar ger, leading male ﬁgure – or ‘Uruk man’,
as he’ s sometimes called in the literature – is supposed to be. According to
the much later story of Gilgamesh, which is set in Uruk, one of the leadersof the youth assembly did manage to catapult himself into the position of
lugal , or king – but if anything like this happened it left no trace in the
written records of the fourth millennium BC, since lists of Uruk ofﬁce
holders have been found, dating to that time, and lugal  is not among them.
(The term only shows up much later , around 2600 BC, at a time when there
are also palaces and other clear signs of royalty .) There is no reason to think
that monarchy – ceremonial or otherwise – played any signiﬁcant role in the
earliest cities of southern Mesopotamia. Quite the opposite, in fact.74
Yet it’s also clear that early inscriptions prise open only a very narrow
window on urban life. W e know something about the mass production of
woollen garments and other commodities in temples; we can also infer that
– somehow or other – these woollens and other temple manufactures were
being traded for wood, metal and precious stone that were not available in
the river valleys, but abounded in the surrounding high country . We know
little about how this trade was or ganized in its earliest days, but we do
know from archaeological evidence that Uruk was establishing colonies,
tiny versions of itself, at many strategic points along the trade routes. Uruk
colonies appear to have been both commercial outposts and religious
centres, and traces of them are found as far north as the T aurus Mountains
and as far east as the Iranian Zagros.75
‘Uruk expansion’, as it is called in the archaeological literature, is
puzzling. There’ s no real evidence of violent conquest, no weapons or
fortiﬁcations, yet at the same time there seems to have been an ef fort to
transform – in ef fect, to colonize – the lives of nearby peoples, to
disseminate the new habits of urban life. In this, the emissaries of Uruk
seem to have proceeded with an almost missionary zeal. T emples were
established, and with them new sorts of clothing, new dairy products, wines
and woollens were disseminated to local populations. While these products
might not have been entirely novel, what the temples introduced was the
principle of standardization: urban temple-factories were literally outputting
products in uniform packages, with the houses of the gods guaranteeing
purity and quality control.76
The entire process was, in a sense, colonial, and it did not go unopposed.
As it turns out, we cannot really understand the rise of what we have come
to call ‘the state’ – and speciﬁcally of aristocracies and monarchies – except
in the lar ger context of that counter -reaction.Perhaps the most revealing site, in this respect, is called Arslantepe – the
‘Hill of the Lion’, in the Malatya Plain of eastern T urkey . Around the same
time Uruk was becoming a lar ge city , Arslantepe was coming into its own
as a regional centre of some signiﬁcance, where the upper reaches of the
Euphrates arc towards the Anti-T aurus Mountains, with their rich sources of
metal and timber . The site may have started life as some kind of seasonal
trade fair; at nearly 3,300 feet above sea level, it was likely snowed in over
the winter months. Even at its peak it was never lar ger than ﬁve hectares,
and there were probably never more than a few hundred people actually
living on the spot. W ithin those ﬁve hectares, however , archaeologists have
unearthed evidence for a remarkable sequence of political developments.77
The story of Arslantepe begins around 3300 BC, when a temple was built
on the site. This temple resembled those of Uruk and her colonies, with
storage areas for food and carefully arranged archives of administrative
seals, just as in any temple of the Mesopotamian ﬂoodplain. But within a
few generations the temple was dismantled, and in its place was built a
massive private structure enclosing a grand audience chamber and living
quarters, as well as storage areas, including an armoury . An assemblage of
swords and spearheads – ﬁnely crafted of arsenic-rich copper and quite
unlike anything found in public buildings of the lowlands at this time –
signals not only control over , but a celebration of the means to enact
violence: a new aesthetics of personal combat and killing. The excavators
have labelled this building the world’ s ‘earliest known palace’.
From 3100 BC, across the hilly country of what’ s now eastern T urkey , and
then in other places on the edge of urban civilization, we see evidence for
the rise of a warrior aristocracy , heavily armed with metal spears and
swords, living in what appear to be hill forts or small palaces. All traces of
bureaucracy disappear . In their place we ﬁnd not just aristocratic
households – reminiscent of Beowulf ’s mead hall, or indeed the Paciﬁc
Northwest Coast in the nineteenth century – but for the ﬁrst time also tombs
of men who, in life, were clearly considered heroic individuals of some sort,
accompanied to the afterlife by prodigious quantities of metal weaponry ,
treasures, elaborate textiles and drinking gear .78
Everything about these tombs and their makers, living on the frontiers of
urban life, bespeaks a spirit of extravagance. Copious amounts of ﬁne food,
drink and personal jewellery were deposited. There are signs that such
funerals could spiral into spectacles of competitive one-upmanship, as whatmust have been priceless trophies, heirlooms and prizes of unparalleled
magniﬁcence were of fered up or even intentionally destroyed; some, too,
are accompanied by subsidiary burials of those apparently slaughtered at
the graveside as of ferings.79 Unlike the isolated ‘princes’ and ‘princesses’
of the Ice Age, there are whole cemeteries full of such burials – for example
at Başur Höyük, on the way to Lake V an, while at Arslantepe we see
exactly the kind of physical infrastructure (forts, storehouses) we might
expect from a society dominated by some sort of warrior aristocracy .
Here we have the very beginnings of an aristocratic ethos with a long
afterlife and some wide ramiﬁcations in the history of Eurasia (something
we touched on earlier , when alluding to Herodotus’ account of the
Scythians, and Ibn Fadlan’ s later observations on the ‘barbarian’ Germanic
tribes of the V olga). W e are witnessing the ﬁrst known emer gence of what
Hector Munro Chadwick famously called ‘heroic societies’ and, moreover ,
these societies all seem to have emer ged just where his analysis tells us to
expect them: on the mar gins of bureaucratically ordered cities.
Writing in the 1920s, Chadwick – Professor of Anglo-Saxon at
Cambridge, at much the same time J. R. R. T olkien held that post at Oxford
– was initially concerned with why great traditions of epic poetry (Nordic
sagas, the works of Homer , the Ramayana ) always seemed to emer ge
among people in contact with and often employed by the urban civilizations
of their day , but who ultimately rejected the values of those same
civilizations. For a long time, his notion of ‘heroic societies’ fell into a
certain disfavour: there was a widespread assumption that such societies did
not really exist but were, like the society represented in Homer ’s Iliad ,
retroactively reconstructed in epic literature.
But as archaeologists have more recently discovered, there is a very real
pattern of heroic burials, indicating in turn an emer ging cultural emphasis
on feasting, drinking, the beauty and fame of the individual male warrior .80
And it appears time and again around the fringes of urban life, often in
strikingly similar forms, over the course of the Eurasian Bronze Age. In
searching for the common features of such ‘heroic societies’, we can ﬁnd a
fairly consistent list in precisely the traditions of epic poetry that Chadwick
compared (in each region, the ﬁrst written versions being much later in date
than the heroic burials themselves, but shedding light on earlier customs).
It’s a list which applies just as well, in most of its features, to the potlatchsocieties of the Northwest Coast or , for that matter , the Māori of New
Zealand.
All these cultures were aristocracies, without any centralized authority or
principle of sovereignty (or , maybe, some lar gely symbolic, formal one).
Instead of a single centre, we ﬁnd numerous heroic ﬁgures competing
ﬁercely with one another for retainers and slaves. ‘Politics’, in such
societies, was composed of a history of personal debts of loyalty or
vengeance between heroic individuals; all, moreover , focus on game-like
contests as the primary business of ritual, indeed political, life.81 Often,
massive amounts of loot or wealth were squandered, sacriﬁced or given
away in such theatrical performances. Moreover , all such groups explicitly
resisted certain features of nearby urban civilizations: above all, writing, for
which they tended to substitute poets or priests who engaged in rote
memorization or elaborate techniques of oral composition. Inside their own
societies, at least, they also rejected commerce. Hence standardized
currency , either in physical or credit forms, tended to be eschewed, with the
focus instead on unique material treasures.
It goes without saying that we cannot possibly hope to trace all these
various tendencies back into periods for which no written testimony exists.
But it is equally clear that, insofar as modern archaeology allows us to
identify an ultimate origin for ‘heroic societies’ of this sort, it is to be found
precisely on the spatial and cultural mar gins of the world’ s ﬁrst great urban
expansion (indeed, some of the earliest aristocratic tombs in the T urkish
highlands were dug directly into the ruins of abandoned Uruk colonies).82
Aristocracies, perhaps monarchy itself, ﬁrst emer ged in opposition to the
egalitarian cities of the Mesopotamian plains, for which they likely had
much the same mixed but ultimately hostile and murderous feelings as
Alaric the Goth would later have towards Rome and everything it stood for ,
Genghis Khan towards Samarkand or Merv , or T imur towards Delhi.
IN WHICH WE CONSIDER WHETHER THE INDUS
CIVILIZA TION W AS AN EXAMPLE OF CASTE BEFORE
KINGSHIP
Fast-forward now 1,000 years from the Uruk expansion to around 2600 BC.
On the banks of the Indus River , in what is today the Pakistani province of
Sindh, a city was founded on vir gin soil: Mohenjo-daro. It remained therefor 700 years.83 The city is considered the greatest expression of a new
form of society that ﬂourished in the valley of the Indus at the time; a form
of society which archaeologists have come to know simply as the ‘Indus’ or
‘Harappan’ civilization. It was South Asia’ s ﬁrst urban culture. Here we
will ﬁnd further evidence that Bronze Age cities – the world’ s ﬁrst lar ge-
scale, planned human settlements – could emer ge in the absence of ruling
classes and managerial elites; but those of the Indus valley also present
some uniquely puzzling features, which archaeologists have debated for
more than a century .84 Let’s introduce both the problem and its key locus –
the site of Mohenjo-daro – in a little more detail.
On ﬁrst inspection, Mohenjo-daro bears out its reputation as the most
completely preserved city of the Bronze Age world. There’ s something
staggering about it all: a brazen modernity , which was not lost on the ﬁrst
excavators of the site, who didn’ t hesitate to designate certain areas ‘high
streets’, ‘police barracks’ and so on (though much of this initial
interpretation, as it turned out, was fantasy). Most of the city consists of the
brick-built houses of the Lower T own, with its grid-like arrangement of
streets, long boulevards and sophisticated drainage and sanitation systems
(terracotta sewage pipes, private and public toilets and bathrooms were
ubiquitous). Above these surprisingly comfortable arrangements loomed the
Upper Citadel, a raised civic centre, also known (for reasons we’ll explain)
as the Mound of the Great Bath. Though both parts of the city stood on
massive artiﬁcial foundations of heaped earth, lifting them above the
ﬂoodplain, the Upper Citadel was also encased in a wall of baked bricks
made to standard dimensions which extended all the way round it, af fording
further protection when the Indus broke its banks.85
In the wider ambit of Indus civilization, there is only one rival to
Mohenjo-daro: the site of Harappa (whence the alternative term ‘Harappan
civilization’). Of similar magnitude, it lies about 370 miles upstream on the
Ravi River , a tributary of the Indus. Many other sites of the same date and
cultural family exist, ranging from lar ge towns to hamlets. They extend
over most of the area of modern-day Pakistan, and well beyond the
ﬂoodplain of the Indus, into northern India. For instance, perched on an
island amid the salt ﬂats of the Great Rann of Kutch lie the striking remains
of Dholavira, a town equipped with over ﬁfteen brick-built reservoirs to
capture rainwater and run-of f from local streams. The Indus civilization had
colonial outposts as far as the Oxus River in northern Afghanistan, wherethe site of Shortugai presents a miniature replica of its urban mother -
culture: ideally placed to tap the rich mineral sources of the Central Asian
highlands (lapis, tin and other gemstones and metals). Such materials were
prized by lowland artisans and their commercial partners as far away as
Iran, Arabia and Mesopotamia. At Lothal, on Gujarat’ s Gulf of Khambhat,
lie remains of a well-appointed port town facing the Arabian Sea,
presumably built by Indus engineers to service maritime trade.86
The Indus civilization had its own script, which appeared and vanished
together with its cities. It has not been deciphered. What survives to us are
mainly short captions, stamped or incised on storage jars, copper tools and
the remnants of a lonely piece of street signage from Dholavira. Short
inscriptions also feature on tiny stone amulets, captioning pictorial vignettes
or miniature animal ﬁgures, carved with striking precision. Most of these
are realistic depictions of water buf falo, elephant, rhinoceros, tiger and
other local fauna, but they also include fantastic beasts, most often
unicorns. Debate surrounds the amulets’ function: were they worn as
personal identiﬁers, for passage through the city’ s gated quarters and walled
compounds, or perhaps to gain entry to ceremonial occasions? Or were they
used for administration, to impress identifying signs on commodities
passing among unknown parties: a Bronze Age origin of product-branding?
Could they be all of these things?87
Aside from our inability to make sense of the Indus script, there are many
puzzling aspects of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Both were excavated in the
early twentieth century , when archaeology was a lar ge-scale and broad-
brush af fair, with sometimes thousands of workers digging simultaneously .
Rapid work on this scale produced striking spatial exposures of street plans,
residential neighbourhoods and entire ceremonial precincts. But it lar gely
neglected to chart the site’ s development over time, a process that can only
be disentangled with more careful methods. For instance, early excavators
recorded just the baked-brick foundations of buildings. The superstructures
were of softer mud-brick, often missed or unwittingly destroyed in the
course of rapid digging; while the upper storeys of lar ge civic structures
were originally of ﬁne timber , rotted or removed for reuse in antiquity .
What seems in plan to be a single phase of urban construction is, in reality ,
a false composite made up of dif ferent elements from various periods of the
city’s history – a city inhabited for over 500 years.88All of which leaves us with plenty of known unknowns, including the
city’s size or population (recent estimates suggest up to 40,000 residents,
but really we can only guess).89 It’s not even clear where to draw the city
boundaries. Some scholars include only the immediately visible areas of the
planned Lower T own and the Upper Citadel as part of the city proper ,
yielding a total area of 100 hectares. Others note scattered evidence for the
city’s extension over a far greater area, maybe three times this size – we’d
have to call them ‘Lower , Lower T owns’ – long since submer ged by
ﬂoodplain soils: a poignant illustration of that conspiracy between nature
and culture which so often makes us for get that shanty dwellers even exist.
But it’ s this last point that leads us in more promising directions. Despite
all its problems, Mohenjo-daro and its sister sites in the Punjab do of fer
some insights into the nature of civic life in the ﬁrst cities of South Asia,
and into the wider question that we posed at the start of this chapter: is there
a causal relationship between scale and inequality in human societies?
Let’s consider , for a moment, what archaeology tells us about wealth
distribution at Mohenjo-daro. Contrary to what we might expect, there is no
concentration of material wealth on the Upper Citadel. Quite the opposite,
in fact. Metals, gemstones and worked shell – for example – were widely
available to households of the Lower T own; archaeologists have recovered
such goods from caches beneath house ﬂoors, and bundles of them are
scattered over every quarter of the site.90 The same goes for little terracotta
ﬁgures of people wearing bangles, diadems and other ﬂashy personal
adornment. Not so the Upper Citadel.
Writing, and also standard weights and measures, were also widely
distributed across the Lower T own; so too evidence for craft occupations
and industries from metalworking and potting to the manufacture of beads.
All ﬂourished down there, in the Lower T own, but are absent from the city’ s
Upper Citadel, where the main civic structures stood.91 Objects made for
personal display had little place, it seems, in the most elevated quarters of
the city . Instead, what deﬁnes the Upper Citadel are buildings like the Great
Bath – a lar ge sunken pool measuring roughly forty feet long and over six
feet deep, lined with carefully executed brickwork, sealed with plaster and
bitumen and entered on either side via steps with timber treads – all
constructed to the ﬁnest architectural standards, yet unmarked by
monuments dedicated to particular rulers, or indeed any other signs of
personal aggrandizement.Because of its lack of royal sculpture, or indeed other forms of
monumental depiction, the Indus valley has been termed a ‘faceless
civilization’.92 At Mohenjo-daro, it seems, the focus of civic life was not a
palace or cenotaph, but a public facility for purifying the body . Brick-made
bathing ﬂoors and platforms also were a standard ﬁxture in most dwellings
of the Lower T own. Citizens seem to have been familiar with very speciﬁc
notions of cleanliness, with daily ablutions apparently forming part of their
domestic routine. The Great Bath was, at one level, an outsized version of
these residential washing facilities. On another level, though, life on the
Upper Citadel seems to negate that of the Lower T own.
So long as the Great Bath was in use – and it was for some centuries – we
ﬁnd no evidence of industrial activities nearby . The narrowing lanes on the
acropolis ef fectively prevented the use of ox-drawn carts and similar
commercial trafﬁc. Here, it was the Bath itself – and the act of bathing –
that became the focus of social life and labour . Barracks and storerooms
adjacent to the Bath housed a staf f (whether in attached or rotating service,
we cannot know) and their essential supplies. The Upper Citadel was a
special sort of ‘city within the city’, in which ordinary principles of
household or ganization went into reverse.93
All this is redolent of the inequality of the caste system, with its
hierarchical division of social functions, or ganized on an ascending scale of
purity .94 But the earliest recorded reference to caste in South Asia comes
only 1,000 years later , in the Rig V eda – an anthology of sacriﬁcial hymns,
ﬁrst committed to writing around 1200 BC. The system, as described in later
Sanskrit epics, consisted of four hereditary ranks or varnas : priests
(brahmins ), warriors or nobles ( kshatriyas ), farmers and traders ( vaishyas )
and labourers ( shudras ); and also those so lowly as to be excluded from the
varnas  entirely . The very top ranks belong to world-renouncers, whose
abstention from trappings of personal status raises them to a higher spiritual
plane. Commerce, industry and status rivalries may all thrive, but the
wealth, power or prosperity being fought over is always seen as of lesser
value – in the great scheme of things – than the purity of priestly caste.
The varna  system is about as ‘unequal’ as any social system can possibly
be, yet where one ranks within it has less to do with how many material
goods one can pile up or lay claim to than with one’ s relation to certain
(polluting) substances – physical dirt and waste, but also bodily matter
linked to birth, death and menstruation – and the people who handle them.All this creates serious problems for any contemporary scholar seeking to
apply Gini coefﬁcients or any other property-based measure of ‘inequality’
to the society in question. On the other hand, and despite the great gaps in
time between our sources, it might allow us to make sense of some of
Mohenjo-daro’ s otherwise puzzling features, such as the fact that those
residential buildings most closely resembling palaces are not located on the
Upper Citadel but crammed into the streets of the Lower T own – that bit
closer to the mud, sewage pipes and paddy ﬁelds, where such jostling for
worldly status seems to have properly belonged.95
Clearly , we can’ t just project the social world evoked in Sanskrit
literature indiscriminately on to the much earlier Indus civilization. If the
ﬁrst South Asian cities were indeed or ganized on caste-like principles, then
we would immediately have to acknowledge a major dif ference from the
system of ranks described over a millennium later in Sanskrit texts, where
second-highest status (just below brahmins ) is reserved for the warrior caste
known as kshatriyas . In the Bronze Age Indus valley there is no evidence of
anything like a kshatriya  class of warrior -nobles, nor of the kind of
aggrandizing behaviour associated with such groups in later epic tales such
as the Mahabharata  or Ramayana . Even the lar gest cities, like Harappa and
Mohenjo-daro, yield no evidence of spectacular sacriﬁces or feasts, no
pictorial narratives of military prowess or celebrations of famous deeds, no
sign of tournaments in which anyone vied over titles and treasures, no
aristocratic burials. And if such things were going on in the Indus cities at
the time, there would be ways to know .
Indus civilization wasn’ t some kind of commercial or spiritual arcadia;
nor was it an entirely peaceful society .96 But neither does it contain any
evidence for charismatic authority ﬁgures: war leaders, lawgivers and the
like. A small, cloaked sculpture made of yellow limestone from Mohenjo-
daro, known in the literature as the ‘priest-king’, is often presented as such.
But, in fact, there’ s no particular reason to believe the ﬁgure really is a
priest-king or an authority ﬁgure of any sort. It’ s simply a limestone image
of an urbane Bronze Age man with a beard. The fact that past generations
of scholars have insisted on referring to him as ‘priest-king’ is testimony
more to their own assumptions about what they think must have been
happening in early Asian cities than anything the evidence implies.
Over time, experts have lar gely come to agree that there’ s no evidence
for priest-kings, warrior nobility , or anything like what we would recognizeas a ‘state’ in the urban civilization of the Indus valley . Can we speak, then,
of ‘egalitarian cities’ here as well, and if so, in what sense? If the Upper
Citadel at Mohenjo-daro really was dominated by some sort of ascetic
order , literally ‘higher ’ than everyone else, and the area around the citadel
by wealthy merchants, then there was a clear hierarchy between groups. Y et
this doesn’ t necessarily mean that the groups themselves were hierarchical
in their internal or ganization, or that ascetics and merchants had a greater
say than anyone else when it came to matters of day-to-day governance.
Now , you might at this point be objecting: ‘well, yes, technically that
may be true, but honestly , what’ s the chance that they weren’ t hierarchical,
or that the pure or the wealthy did not have greater say in running the city’ s
affairs?’ In fact, it seems very difﬁcult for most of us even to imagine how
self-conscious egalitarianism on a lar ge scale would work. But this again
simply serves to demonstrate how automatically we have come to accept an
evolutionary narrative in which authoritarian rule is somehow the natural
outcome whenever a lar ge enough group of people are brought together
(and, by implication, that something called ‘democracy’ emer ges only much
later, as a conceptual breakthrough – and most likely just once, in ancient
Greece).
Scholars tend to demand clear and irrefutable evidence for the existence
of democratic institutions of any sort in the distant past. It’ s striking how
they never demand comparably rigorous proof for top-down structures of
authority . These latter are usually treated as a default mode of history: the
kind of social structures you would simply expect to see in the absence of
evidence for anything else.97 We could speculate about where this habit of
thought comes from, but it wouldn’ t help us to decide if the everyday
governance of early Indus cities could have proceeded on egalitarian lines,
alongside the existence of ascetic social orders. It is more useful, we
suggest, to level the interpretive playing ﬁeld by asking if there are cases of
such things happening in later , better -documented periods of South Asian
history .
In fact, such cases are not difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Consider the social milieu
from which Buddhist monasteries, or sangha , arose. The word sangha  was
actually ﬁrst used for the popular assemblies that governed many South
Asian cities in the Buddha’ s lifetime – roughly the ﬁfth century BC – and
early Buddhist texts insist that the Buddha was himself inspired by the
example of these republics, and in particular the importance they accordedto convening full and frequent public assemblies. Early Buddhist sanghas
were meticulous in their demands for all monks to gather together in order
to reach unanimous decisions on matters of general concern, resorting to
majority vote only when consensus broke down.98 All this remains true of
sangha  to this day . Over the course of time, Buddhist monasteries have
varied a great deal in governance – many have been extremely hierarchical
in practice. But the important thing here is that even 2,000 years ago it was
not considered in any way unusual for members of ascetic orders to make
decisions in much the same way as, for example, contemporary anti-
authoritarian activists do in Europe or Latin America (by consensus
process, with a fallback on majority vote); that these forms of governance
were based on an ideal of equality; and that there were entire cities
governed in what was seen to be exactly the same way .99
We might go further still and ask: are there any known examples of
societies with formal caste hierarchies, in which practical governance
nonetheless takes place on egalitarian lines? It may seem paradoxical but
the answer , again, is yes: there is plenty of evidence for such arrangements,
some of which continue to this day . Perhaps best documented is the seka
system on the island of Bali, whose population adopted Hinduism in the
Middle Ages. Balinese are not only divided by caste: their society is
conceived as a total hierarchy in which not just every group but every
individual knows (or at least, should know) their exact position in relation
to everyone else. In principle, then, there are no equals, and most Balinese
would ar gue that in the greater cosmic scheme of things, this must always
be so.
At the same time, however , practical af fairs such as the management of
communities, temples and agricultural life are or ganized according to the
seka system, in which everyone is expected to participate on equal terms
and come to decisions by consensus. For instance, if a neighbourhood
association meets to discuss repairing the roofs of public buildings, or what
to serve for food during an upcoming dance contest, those who consider
themselves particularly high and mighty , offended by the prospect of having
to sit in a circle on the ground with lowly neighbours, may choose not to
attend; but in that case they are obliged to pay ﬁnes for non-attendance –
ﬁnes which are then used to pay for the feast or the repairs.100 We currently
have no way of knowing if such a system prevailed in the Indus valley over
4,000 years ago. The example merely serves to underscore that there is nonecessary correspondence between overarching concepts of social hierarchy
and the practical mechanics of local governance.
The same is, incidentally , true of kingdoms and empires. One very
common theory held that these tended to ﬁrst appear in river valleys,
because agriculture there involved the maintenance of complex irrigation
systems, which in turn required some form of administrative co-ordination
and control. Bali again provides the perfect counter -example. For most of
its history Bali was divided into a series of kingdoms, endlessly squabbling
over this or that. It is also famous as a rather small volcanic island which
manages to support one of the densest populations on earth by a complex
system of irrigated wet-rice agriculture. Y et the kingdoms seem to have had
no role whatsoever in the management of the irrigation system. This was
governed by a series of ‘water -temples’, through which the distribution of
water was managed by an even more complex system of consensual
decision-making, according to egalitarian principles, by the farmers
themselves.101
CONCERNING AN APP ARENT CASE OF ‘URBAN
REVOLUTION’ IN CHINESE PREHIST ORY
So far in this chapter we’ve looked at what happened when cities ﬁrst
appeared in three distinct parts of Eurasia. In each case, we noted the
absence of monarchs or any evidence of a warrior elite, and the
corresponding likelihood that each had instead developed institutions of
communal self-governance. W ithin those broad parameters, each regional
tradition was very dif ferent. Contrasts between the expansion of Uruk and
the Ukrainian mega-sites illustrate this point with particular clarity . Both
appear to have developed an ethos of explicit egalitarianism – but it took
strikingly dif ferent forms in each.
It is possible to express these dif ferences at a purely formal level. A self-
conscious ethos of egalitarianism, at any point in history , might take either
of two diametrically opposing forms. W e can insist that everyone is, or
should be, precisely the same (at least in the ways that we consider
important); or alternatively , we can insist that everyone is so utterly
different from each other that there are simply no criteria for comparison
(for example, we are all unique individuals, and so there is no basis uponwhich any one of us can be considered better than another). Real-life
egalitarianism will normally tend to involve a bit of both.
Yet it could be ar gued that Mesopotamia – with its standardized
household products, allocation of uniform payments to temple employees,
and public assemblies – seems to have lar gely embraced the ﬁrst version.
Ukrainian mega-sites, in which each household seems to have developed its
own unique artistic style and, presumably , idiosyncratic domestic rituals,
embraced the second.102 The Indus valley appears – if our interpretation is
broadly correct – to represent yet a third possibility , where rigorous equality
in certain areas (even the bricks were all precisely the same size) was
complemented by explicit hierarchy in others.
It’s important to stress that we are not ar guing that the very ﬁrst cities to
appear in any region of the world were invariably founded on egalitarian
principles (in fact, we will shortly see a perfect counter -example). What we
are saying is that archaeological evidence shows this to have been a
surprisingly common pattern, which goes against conventional evolutionary
assumptions about the ef fects of scale on human society . In each of the
cases we’ve considered so far – Ukrainian mega-sites, Uruk Mesopotamia,
the Indus valley – a dramatic increase in the scale of or ganized human
settlement took place with no resulting concentration of wealth or power in
the hands of ruling elites. In short, archaeological research has shifted the
burden of proof on to those theorists who claim causal connections between
the origins of cities and the rise of stratiﬁed states, and whose claims now
look increasingly hollow .
So far we’ve been providing what are ef fectively a series of snapshot views
of cities that, in most cases, were occupied for centuries. It seems unlikely
that they did not have their own share of upheavals, transformations and
constitutional crises. In some cases we can be certain they did. At Mohenjo-
daro, for instance, we know that roughly 200 years before the city’ s demise,
the Great Bath had already fallen into disrepair . Industrial facilities and
ordinary residences crept beyond the Lower T own, on to the Upper Citadel,
and even the site of the Bath itself. W ithin the Lower T own, we now ﬁnd
buildings of truly palatial dimensions with attached craft workshops.103
This ‘other ’ Mohenjo-daro existed for generations, and seems to represent a
self-conscious project of transforming the city’ s (by then centuries-old)hierarchy into something else – though archaeologists have yet to fathom
quite what that other thing was supposed to be.
Like the Ukrainian cities, those of the Indus were eventually abandoned
entirely , to be replaced by societies of much smaller scale where heroic
aristocrats held sway . In Mesopotamian cities palaces eventually appear .
Overall, one might be for given for thinking that history was progressing
uniformly in an authoritarian direction. And in the very long run it was; at
least, by the time we have written histories, lords and kings and would-be
world emperors have popped up almost everywhere (though civic
institutions and independent cities never entirely go away).104 Still, rushing
to this conclusion would be unwise. Dramatic reversals have sometimes
taken place in the other direction – for instance in China.
In China, archaeology has opened a yawning chasm between the birth of
cities and the appearance of the earliest named royal dynasty , the Shang.
Since the early twentieth century discovery of inscribed oracle bones at
Anyang in the north-central province of Henan, political history in China
has started with the Shang rulers, who came to power around 1200 BC.105
Until quite recently , Shang civilization was thought to be a fusion of earlier
urban (‘Erligang’ and ‘Erlitou’) and aristocratic or ‘nomadic’ elements, the
latter taking the form of bronze casting techniques, new types of weaponry ,
and horse-drawn chariots ﬁrst developed on the Inner Asian steppe, home to
a series of powerful and highly mobile societies who played so much havoc
with later Chinese history .106
Before the Shang, nothing particularly interesting was supposed to have
happened – just a few decades ago, textbooks on early China simply
presented a long series of ‘Neolithic’ cultures receding into the distant past,
deﬁned by technological trends in farming and stylistic changes in regional
traditions of pottery and the design of ritual jades. The underlying
assumption was that these were pretty much the same as Neolithic farmers
were imagined to be anywhere else: living in villages, developing
embryonic forms of social inequality , preparing the way for the sudden leap
that would bring the rise of cities and, with cities, the ﬁrst dynastic states
and empires. But we now know this is not what happened at all.
Today , archaeologists in China speak of a ‘Late Neolithic’ or ‘Longshan’
period marked by what can be described, without equivocation, as cities.
Already by 2600 BC we ﬁnd a spread of settlements surrounded by rammed
earth walls across the entire valley of the Y ellow River , from the coastalmargins of Shandong to the mountains of southern Shanxi. They range in
size from centres of more than 300 hectares to tiny principalities, little more
than villages but still fortiﬁed.107 The major demographic hubs lay far
away , on the lower reaches of the Y ellow River to the east; also to the west
of Henan, in the Fen River valley of Shanxi province; and in the Liangzhu
culture of southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang.108
Many of the lar gest Neolithic cities contain cemeteries, where individual
burials hold tens or even hundreds of carved ritual jades. These may be
badges of ofﬁce, or perhaps a form of ritual currency: in ancestral rites, the
stacking and combination of such jades, often in great number , allowed
differences of rank to be measured along a common scale of value,
spanning the living and the dead. Accommodating such ﬁnds in the annals
of written Chinese history proved an uncomfortable task, since we are
speaking of a long and apparently tumultuous epoch that just wasn’ t
supposed to have happened.109
The problem is not merely one of time, but also of space. Astonishingly ,
some of the most striking ‘Neolithic’ leaps towards urban life are now
known to have taken place in the far north, on the frontier with Mongolia.
From the perspective of later Chinese empires (and the historians who
described them), these regions were already halfway to ‘nomad-barbarian’
and would eventually end up beyond the Great W all. Nobody expected
archaeologists to ﬁnd there, of all places, a 4,000-year -old city , extending
over 400 hectares, with a great stone wall enclosing palaces and a step-
pyramid, lording it over a subservient rural hinterland nearly 1,000 years
pre-Shang.
The excavations at Shimao, on the T uwei River , have revealed all this,
along with abundant evidence for sophisticated crafts – including bone-
working and bronze-casting – and warfare, including the mass killing and
burial of captives, in around 2000 BC.1 10 Here we sense a much livelier
political scene than was ever imagined in the annals of later courtly
tradition. Some of it had a grisly aspect, including the decapitation of
captured foes, and the burial of some thousands of ancestral jade axes and
sceptres in cracks between great stone blocks of the city wall, not to be
found or seen again until the prying eyes of archaeologists uncovered them
over four millennia later . The likely intention of all this was to disrupt,
demoralize and delegitimize rival lineages (‘all in all, you’re just another
jade in the wall’).At the site of T aosi – contemporary with Shimao, but located far to the
south in the Jinnan basin – we ﬁnd a rather dif ferent story . Between 2300
and 1800 BC, Taosi went through three phases of expansion. First, a fortiﬁed
town of sixty hectares arose on the ruins of a village, expanding
subsequently to a city of 300 hectares. In these early and middle periods,
Taosi presents evidence for social stratiﬁcation almost as dramatic as what
we see at Shimao, or indeed what we might expect of a later imperial
Chinese capital. There were massive enclosure walls, road systems and
large, protected storage areas; also rigid segregation between commoner
and elite quarters, with craft workshops and a calendrical monument
clustered around what was most likely some sort of palace.
Burials in the early town cemetery of T aosi fell into clearly distinct social
classes. Commoner tombs were modest; elite tombs were full of hundreds
of lacquered vessels, ceremonial jade axes and remains of extravagant pork
feasts. Then suddenly , around 2000 BC, everything seems to change. As the
excavator describes it:
The city wall was razed ﬂat, and … the original functional divisions
destroyed, resulting in a lack of spatial regulation. Commoners’
residential areas now covered almost the entire site, even reaching
beyond the boundaries of the middle-period lar ge city wall. The size
of the city became even lar ger, reaching a total area of 300 hectares.
In addition, the ritual area in the south was abandoned. The former
palace area now included a poor -quality rammed-earth foundation of
about 2,000 square metres, surrounded by trash pits used by
relatively low-status people. Stone tool workshops occupied what
had been the lower -level elite residential area. The city clearly had
lost its status as a capital, and was in a state of anarchy .1 1 1
What’ s more, there are clues that this was a conscious process of
transformation, most likely involving a signiﬁcant degree of violence.
Commoner graves burst in on the elite cemetery , and in the palace district a
mass burial, with signs of torture and grotesque violations of the corpses,
appears to be evidence for what the excavator describes as an ‘act of
political retribution’.1 12
Now , it is considered bad form to question an excavator ’s ﬁrst-hand
judgement about a site, but we cannot resist a couple of observations. First,the ostensible ‘state of anarchy’ (elsewhere described as ‘collapse and
chaos’)1 13 lasted for a considerable period of time, between two and three
centuries. Second, the overall size of T aosi during the latter period actually
grew from 280 to 300 hectares. This sounds a lot less like collapse than an
age of widespread prosperity , following the abolition of a rigid class
system. It suggests that after the destruction of the palace, people did not
fall into a Hobbesian ‘war of all against all’ but simply got on with their
lives – presumably under what they considered a more equitable system of
local self-governance.
Here, on the banks of the Fen River , we might conceivably be in the
presence of evidence for the world’ s ﬁrst documented social revolution, or
at least the ﬁrst in an urban setting. Other interpretations are no doubt
possible. But at the very least, the case of T aosi invites us to consider the
world’ s earliest cities as places of self-conscious social experimentation,
where very dif ferent visions of what a city could be like might clash –
sometimes peacefully , sometimes erupting in bursts of extraordinary
violence. Increasing the number of people living in one place may vastly
increase the range of social possibilities, but in no sense does it
predetermine which of those possibilities will ultimately be realized.
As we’ll see in the next chapter , the history of central Mexico suggests
that the kinds of revolution we’ve been talking about – urban revolutions of
the political kind – may well be a lot more common in human history than
we tend to think. Again, we may never be able fully to reconstruct the
unwritten constitutions of the earliest cities to appear in various parts of the
world, or the reforms under gone in their ﬁrst centuries, but we can no
longer doubt that these existed.9
Hiding in Plain Sight
The indigenous origins of social housing and democracy in the Americas
Sometime around AD 1150, a people called the Mexica migrated south from
a place called Aztlán – its location is now unknown – to take up a new
home in the heart of the V alley of Mexico, which now bears their name.1
There they were eventually to carve out an empire, the Aztec T riple
Alliance,2 and build its capital at T enochtitlan, an island-city in Lake
Texcoco – one link in a chain of great lakes and lake-cities, and part of an
urban landscape ringed by mountains. Lacking an urban tradition of their
own, the Mexica modelled the layout of T enochtitlan on that of another city
they found, lying in ruins and virtually abandoned, in a valley about one
day’s journey distant. They called that other city T eotihuacan, the ‘Place of
Gods’.
It had been some time since anyone lived in T eotihuacan. By the twelfth
century , when the Mexica arrived, nobody even seems to have remembered
the city’ s original name. Still, the new arrivals clearly found the city – with
its two colossal pyramids set against the Cerro Gordo – both alien and
alluring, and far too lar ge simply to ignore. Their response, aside from
using it as a model for their own great city , was to veil T eotihuacan in myth,
and cage its standing remains in a dense forest of names and symbols. As a
result, we still see T eotihuacan lar gely through Aztec (Culhua-Mexica)
eyes.3
Written references to T eotihuacan from the time it was still inhabited
comprise a few tantalizing inscriptions from far to the east in the Maya
lowlands, which call it ‘the place of cattail reeds’, corresponding to the
Nahuatl word ‘T ollan’ and evoking a primordial, perfect city by the water .4
Otherwise all we have are sixteenth-century transcriptions of chronicles, set
down in Spanish and Nahuatl, which describe T eotihuacan as a place full ofmountain pools and primal voids, from which the planets sprang at the
beginning of time. The planets were followed by gods, and the gods by a
mysterious race of ﬁsh-men, whose world had to be destroyed to make way
for our own.
In historical terms, such sources are not very useful, especially since we
have no way of knowing if these myths were ever told in the city when it
was actually inhabited, or whether they were just invented by the Aztecs.
Still, the legacy of those stories continues. It was the Aztecs, for instance,
who made up the names ‘Pyramid of the Sun’, ‘Pyramid of the Moon’ and
‘Way of the Dead’, which archaeologists and tourists alike use to this day
when describing the city’ s most visible monuments and the road that links
them all.5
For all their facility with astronomical calculation, the builders of
Tenochtitlan either didn’ t know or didn’ t ﬁnd it important to know when,
precisely , Teotihuacan had last been inhabited. Here, at least, archaeology
has been able to ﬁll in the gaps. W e know now that the city of T eotihuacan
had its heyday eight centuries before the coming of the Mexica, and more
than 1,000 years before the arrival of the Spanish. Its foundation dates to
around 100 BC, and its decline to around AD 600. W e also know that, in the
course of those centuries, T eotihuacan became a city of such grandeur and
sophistication that it could easily be put on a par with Rome at the height of
its imperial power .
We don’ t actually know if T eotihuacan was, like Rome, the centre of a
great empire, but even conservative estimates place its population at around
100,0006 (perhaps as much as ﬁve times the likely population of Mohenjo-
daro, Uruk or any of the other early Eurasian cities we discussed in the last
chapter). At its zenith, there were probably at least a million people
distributed across the V alley of Mexico and surrounding lands, many of
whom had only visited the great city once, or perhaps only knew someone
who had, but nonetheless considered T eotihuacan the most important place
in the entire world.
This much is broadly accepted by virtually every scholar and historian of
ancient Mexico. More controversial is the question of what sort of city
Teotihuacan was, and how it was governed. Pose this question to a
specialist in the study of Mesoamerican history or archaeology (as we often
have done), and you’ll likely get the same reaction: a roll of the eyes and a
resigned acknowledgement that there’ s just something ‘weird’ about theplace. Not merely because of its exceptional size, but because of its
stubborn refusal to conform to expectations of how an early Mesoamerican
city should  have functioned.
At this point, the reader can probably guess what’ s coming. All the
evidence suggests that T eotihuacan had, at its height of its power , found a
way to govern itself without overlords – as did the much earlier cities of
prehistoric Ukraine, Uruk-period Mesopotamia and Bronze Age Pakistan.
Yet it did so with a very dif ferent technological foundation, and on an even
larger scale.
But ﬁrst some background.
As we’ve seen, when kings appear in the historical record, they tend to
leave unmistakeable traces. W e can expect to ﬁnd palaces, rich burials and
monuments celebrating their conquests. All this is true in Mesoamerica as
well.
In the wider region, the paradigm is set by a series of dynastic polities,
located far from the V alley of Mexico in the Y ucatán Peninsula and adjacent
highlands. T oday’ s historians know these polities as the Classic Maya ( c. AD
150–900 – the term ‘classic’ is also applied to their ancient written
language and to the chronological period in question). Cities like T ikal,
Calakmul or Palenque were dominated by royal temples, ball-courts
(settings for competitive, sometimes lethal games), images of war and
humiliated captives (often publicly killed after ball games), complex
calendrical rituals celebrating royal ancestors, and records of the deeds and
biographies of living kings. In the modern imagination this has become the
‘standard package’ of Mesoamerican kingship, associated with ancient
cities throughout the region from Monte Alban (in Oaxaca, c. AD 500–800)
to Tula (in central Mexico, c. AD 850–1 150), and ar guably reaching as far
north as Cahokia (near what’ s now East St Louis, c. AD 800–1200).
In Teotihuacan, all this seems to have been strikingly absent. Unlike in
the Mayan cities, there are few written inscriptions in general.7 (For this
reason, we don’ t know what language was spoken by the majority of
Teotihuacan’ s inhabitants, although we know the city was sufﬁciently
cosmopolitan to include among its population both Maya and Zapotec
minorities familiar with the use of writing.)8 However , there remains
plenty of pictorial art. T eotihuacan’ s citizens were proliﬁc craft specialists
and makers of images, leaving behind everything from monumental stonesculptures to diminutive terracotta ﬁgures that could be held in the palm, as
well as vivid wall paintings bustling with human activity (picture something
like the carnivalesque feel of a Bruegel street scene and you are not too far
off). Still, nowhere among some thousands of such images do we ﬁnd even
a single representation of a ruler striking, binding or otherwise dominating a
subordinate – unlike in the contemporary arts of the Maya and Zapotec,
where this is a constant theme. T oday scholars pore over T eotihuacan
imagery , searching for anything that might be construed as a kingly ﬁgure,
but lar gely they fail. In many cases the artists seem to have deliberately
frustrated such ef forts, for instance by making all the ﬁgures in a given
scene exactly the same size.
Another key element of royal display in the ancient kingdoms of
Mesoamerica, the ceremonial ball-court is also conspicuous by its absence
at Teotihuacan.9 Neither has there been found any equivalent to the great
tombs of Sihyaj Chan K’awiil at T ikal or K’inich Janaab Pakal in Palenque.
And not for lack of trying. Archaeologists have combed through the ancient
tunnels around the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon and under the T emple
of the Feathered Serpent, only to discover that the passages do not lead to
royal tombs, or even robbed-out tomb chambers, but to chthonic labyrinths
and mineral-crusted shrines: evocations of other worlds, no doubt, but not
the graves of sacred rulers.10
Some have suggested that the self-conscious rejection of outside
convention at T eotihuacan runs even deeper . For instance, the city’ s artists
appear to have been aware of formal and compositional principles found
among their Mesoamerican neighbours, and to have set about deliberately
inverting them. Where Maya and Zapotec art draws on a tradition of relief
carving derived from the earlier Olmec kings of V eracruz, favouring curves
and ﬂowing forms, the sculpture of T eotihuacan shows humans and
humanoid ﬁgures as ﬂat composites, tightly ﬁtted to angular blocks. Some
decades ago, these contrasts led Esther Pasztory – a Hungarian-American
art historian who spent much of her career studying T eotihuacan’ s art and
imagery – to a radical conclusion. What we have, she ar gued, with highland
Teotihuacan and the lowland Maya, is nothing less than a case of conscious
cultural inversion – or what we’ve been calling schismogenesis – but this
time on the scale of urban civilizations.1 1
Teotihuacan, in Pasztory’ s view , created a new tradition of art to express
the ways in which its society was dif ferent from that of its contemporarieselsewhere in Mesoamerica. In doing so it rejected both the speciﬁc visual
trope of ruler and captive and the gloriﬁcation of aristocratic individuals in
general. In this it was strikingly dif ferent from both the earlier cultural
tradition of the Olmec, and from contemporary Maya polities. If the visual
arts of T eotihuacan celebrated anything, Pasztory insisted, then it was the
community as a whole and its collective values, which – over a period of
some centuries – successfully prevented the emer gence of ‘dynastic
personality cults’.12
According to Pasztory , Teotihuacan was not just ‘anti-dynastic’ in spirit,
it was itself a utopian experiment in urban life. Those who created it
thought of themselves as creating a new and dif ferent kind of city , a Tollan
for the people, without overlords or kings. Following in Pasztory’ s
footsteps, other scholars, eliminating virtually every other possibility ,
arrived at similar conclusions. In its early years, they concluded,
Teotihuacan had gone some way down the road to authoritarian rule, but
then around AD 300 suddenly reversed course: possibly there was a
revolution of sorts, followed by a more equal distribution of the city’ s
resources and the establishment of a kind of ‘collective governance’.13
The general consensus among those who know the site best is that
Teotihuacan was, in fact, a city or ganized along some sort of self-
consciously egalitarian lines. And, as we’ve seen, in world-historical terms
all this is not nearly as weird or anomalous as scholars – or anyone else, for
that matter – tend to assume. It is equally true if we simply try to
understand T eotihuacan within its Mesoamerican context. The city didn’ t
come out of nowhere. While there might be a recognizable ‘package’ of
Mesoamerican kingship, there also appears to have been a very dif ferent,
dare we say republican, tradition as well.
What we propose to do in this chapter , then, is bring to the surface this
neglected strand of Mesoamerican social history: one of urban republics,
large-scale projects of social welfare, and indigenous forms of democracy
that can be followed down to the time of the Spanish conquest and beyond.
IN WHICH WE FIRST CONSIDER AN EXAMPLE OF
STRANGER-KINGS IN THE MA YA LOWLANDS, AND THEIR
AFFILIA TION WITH TEOTIHUACANLet us start by leaving behind the city itself, and the valleys and plateaus of
central Mexico, for the tropical forest kingdoms of the Classic Maya, whose
ruins lie to the east: in Mexico’ s Yucatán Peninsula, and within the modern
countries of Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador . In the ﬁfth
century AD, something remarkable happens in the art and writing of some of
these Maya city-states, including the lar gest and most prominent among
them, T ikal.
Finely carved scenes on Mayan monuments of this period show ﬁgures
seated on thrones, and wearing what can be instantly recognized as foreign,
Teotihuacan-style dress and weaponry (the spear -throwers called atlatls ,
feathered shields, and so on), clearly distinct from the garb and ﬁnery of
local rulers. Archaeologists working in western Honduras, near the border
with Guatemala, have even unearthed what, judging by the grave goods,
appear to be the actual burials of these stranger -kings at the base level of a
temple at the site of Copán, which went through seven further phases of
construction. Here, glyphic inscriptions describe at least some of these
individuals as actually coming from the Land of the Cattail Reeds.14
Two things (at least) are very hard to explain here. First, why are there
images of what appear to be T eotihuacano lords on thrones in T ikal, when
there are no similar images of lords sitting on thrones at T eotihuacan itself?
Second, how could T eotihuacan ever have mounted a successful military
expedition against a kingdom over 600 miles away? Most experts assume
the latter was simply impossible on logistical grounds, and they are
probably correct to do so (although we should keep an open mind; after all,
who could have predicted on logistical grounds that a motley crew of
Spaniards would bring down a Mesoamerican empire of many millions?).
The ﬁrst question certainly requires more careful consideration. W ere the
individuals depicted as seated kings really from central Mexico at all?
It’s possible we are just dealing here with local lords who had a taste for
exotica. W e know from art and inscriptions that Maya grandees sometimes
enjoyed dressing up in T eotihuacan warrior gear , sometimes beheld visions
of Teotihuacan spirits after ritual bloodletting, and generally liked to style
themselves ‘Lords and Ladies of the W est’. The city was certainly far
enough away for the Maya to see it as a place of exotic fantasies, some kind
of distant Shangri-La. But there are reasons to suspect it was more than just
that. For one thing, people did regularly move back and forth. Obsidian
from T eotihuacan adorned the Maya gods, and T eotihuacan’ s deities woregreen quetzal feathers from the Maya lowlands. Mercenaries and traders
went both ways, pilgrimages and diplomatic visits followed; immigrants
from T eotihuacan built temples in Maya cities, and there was even a Maya
neighbourhood, replete with murals, at T eotihuacan itself.15
How do we resolve the puzzle of this Mayan depiction of T eotihuacan
kings? W ell, ﬁrst of all, if history teaches us anything about long-distance
trade routes, it’ s that they are likely to be full of unscrupulous characters of
various sorts: bandits, runaways, grifters, smugglers, religious visionaries,
spies – or ﬁgures who may be any combination of these at a given time.
This was no less true in Mesoamerica than anywhere else. The Aztecs, for
instance, employed orders of heavily armed warrior -merchants called
pochteca , who also gathered intelligence on the cities where they traded.
History is also full of stories of adventurous travellers who either ﬁnd
themselves taken into some alien society and miraculously transformed
there into kings or embodiments of sacred power: ‘stranger -kings’ like
Captain James Cook, who – on casting anchor in Hawaii in 1779 – was
accorded the status of an ancient Polynesian fertility god called Lono; or
others who, like Hernán Cortés, did their best to convince local people that
they should be welcomed as such.16 Worldwide, a remarkably lar ge
percentage of dynastic histories begin precisely this way , with a man (it’ s
almost always a man) who mysteriously appears from somewhere far away .
It is easy to see how an adventurous traveller from a famous city might
have taken advantage of such notions. Could something like this have
happened in the Maya lowlands in the ﬁfth century AD?
From inscriptions at T ikal, we do know the names of some of these
particular stranger -kings and their close associates, or at least the names
they adopted as Maya nobles. One, called Sihyaj K’ahk’ (‘Born of Fire’),
seems never himself to have ruled but helped install a series of
Teotihuacano ‘princes’ on Maya thrones, including the throne of T ikal. W e
also know that these princes married local women of high rank, and that
their of fspring became Maya rulers, who also celebrated their ancestral
connection to T eotihuacan: the ‘T ollan of the W est’.
From examination of burials at Copán we also know that, before their
elevation to royal status, at least some of these adventurous individuals led
extremely colourful lives, ﬁghting and travelling and ﬁghting again, and
that they may not originally have come either from Copán or from
Teotihuacan but somewhere else entirely .17 Taking all lines of evidenceinto account, it seems likely that these progenitors of Maya dynasties were
originally members of groups that specialized in long-distance travel –
traders, soldiers of fortune, missionaries or perhaps even spies – who,
perhaps quite suddenly , found themselves elevated to royalty .18
There is a remarkable analogy for this process closer to our times. Many
centuries later , when the focus of Maya culture – and most of its lar gest
cities – had shifted to Y ucatán in the north, a similar wave of central
Mexican inﬂuence occurred, most dramatically evident in the city of
Chichén Itzá, whose T emple of the W arriors seems to be directly modelled
on the T oltec capital of T ula (a later T ollan). Again, we don’ t really know
what happened, but later chronicles, written secretly under Spanish rule,
described the Itzá in almost exactly these terms: as a band of uprooted
warriors, ‘stuttering foreigners’ from the west, who managed to seize
control of a series of cities in Y ucatán and ended up in a prolonged rivalry
with another dynasty of T oltec exiles – or at least, exiles who insisted they
were originally T oltec – called the Xiu.19 These chronicles are full of
accounts of the exiles’ wanderings in the wilderness, temporary periods of
glory , accusations of oppression, and sombre prophecies of future
tribulation. Once again, we seem to be dealing with a feeling among the
Maya that kings really should  come from somewhere far away , and with the
willingness of at least a few unscrupulous foreigners to take advantage of
this idea.
All this is only guesswork. Still, it’ s clear the images and records from
places like T ikal tell us more about Maya concepts of royal power than they
do about T eotihuacan itself, where not a shred of compelling evidence for
the institution of kingship has yet been found. The ‘Mexican’ princes of the
Maya lowlands, bedecked in regalia and seated on thrones, were engaging
in exactly the sort of grandiose political gestures that had no place in their
putative homeland. If not a monarchy , then, what was T eotihuacan? There
is, we suggest, no one answer to this question – and over a period of ﬁve
centuries there is no particular reason why there ought to be.
Let’s look at a central portion of the standard architectural plan of
Teotihuacan, pieced together from the most exhaustive survey of an urban
landscape ever undertaken by archaeologists.20 Having gone to the lengths
of recording a built environment on that scale – all eight square miles of it –
archaeologists naturally want to see it all at once, in a single gasp. Modernarchaeology often presents to us something like the chronologically
collapsed plan of Mohenjo-daro and other ‘ﬁrst cities’ with centuries or
even millennia of urban history folded into a single map. It’ s visually
stunning, but actually quite ﬂat and artiﬁcial. In the case of T eotihuacan, it
gives an ef fect at once harmonious and misleading.
At the centre, anchoring the whole mirage, stand the great monuments –
the two Pyramids and the Ciudadela (Citadel) containing the T emple of the
Feathered Serpent. Extending for miles around are smaller but still
impressively appointed residences that housed the city’ s population: some
2,000 multi-family apartments, ﬁnely built from stone masonry and
organized on a tidy orthogonal grid, aligned to the ceremonial centre of the
city. It is an almost perfectly functional image of civic prosperity and
hierarchy . We are, it would seem, in the presence of something like More’ s
Utopia  or Campanella’ s City of the Sun . But there is a problem. The
residences and pyramids do not strictly belong together , or at least not all of
them. Their construction occupies dif ferent phases of time. Nor is the
temple quite what it seems.
In fact, in historical terms it is all something of a grand illusion. T o
understand what’ s going on here we have to make some attempt, however
tentative, to reconstruct a basic chronological sequence for the city’ s
development.
HOW THE PEOPLE OF TEOTIHUACAN TURNED THEIR BACKS
ON MONUMENT -BUILDING AND HUMAN SACRIFICE, AND
INSTEAD EMBARKED ON A REMARKABLE PROJECT OF
SOCIAL HOUSING
Teotihuacan’ s growth to urban dimensions began around the year 0. At that
time, whole populations were on the move across the Basin of Mexico and
Valley of Puebla, ﬂeeing the ef fects of seismic activity on their southern
frontiers, which included a Plinian eruption of the volcano Popocatépetl.
From AD 50 to 150, the ﬂow of people into T eotihuacan siphoned life from
surrounding areas. V illages and towns were abandoned, and also whole
cities, like Cuicuilco, with its early traditions of pyramid-building. Under
several feet of ash lie the ruins of other abandoned settlements. At the
Pueblan site of T etimpa, just eight miles from Popocatépetl, archaeologistshave unearthed houses that foreshadow – on a smaller scale – the civic
architecture of T eotihuacan.21
Here the later chronicles do provide some useful, or at least thought-
provoking accounts. Folk memories of a mass exodus survived right up to
the time of the conquista . One tradition, preserved in the work of the
Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún, tells how T eotihuacan was founded
by a coalition of elders, priests and wise men from other settlements. As the
city grew it incorporated these smaller traditions, maize gods and village
ancestors rubbing shoulders with urban deities of ﬁre and rain.
What we can refer to as T eotihuacan’ s ‘Old City’ was or ganized on a
parish system, with local shrines serving particular neighbourhoods. The
layout of these district temples – three buildings around a central plaza –
also follows the plan of earlier structures at T etimpa, which housed the cults
of village ancestors.22 In these early days, from AD 100 to 200, the
residential quarters of T eotihuacan may well have looked like an enormous
shanty town – but we don’ t really know ,23 just as we have no clear idea
how the ﬂedgling city divided access to arable land and other resources
among its citizens. Maize was widely farmed, to be eaten by humans and
domestic animals. People kept and ate turkeys, dogs, rabbits and hares.
They also grew beans, and enjoyed access to whitetail deer and peccaries,
as well as wild fruits and vegetables. Seafood arrived from the distant coast,
presumably smoked or salted; but how far the various sectors of the urban
economy were integrated at this time, and how exactly resources were
pulled in from a wider hinterland, is altogether unclear .24What we can say is that the T eotihuacanos’ ef forts to create a civic
identity focused initially on the building of monuments: the raising of a
sacred city in the midst of the wider urban sprawl.25 This meant the
creation of an entirely new landscape in the centre of T eotihuacan, requiring
the work of some thousands of labourers. Pyramid-mountains and artiﬁcial
rivers went up, providing a stage for the performance of calendrical rituals.
In a colossal feat of civil engineering, the channels of the Rio San Juan and
Rio San Lorenzo were diverted, tying them to the city’ s orthogonal grid and
transforming their marshy banks into solid foundations (all this, recall,
without the beneﬁt of working animals or metal tools). This in turn laid the
basis for a grand architectural programme which saw the erection of the
Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon and the T emple of the Feathered
Serpent. The temple faced a sunken plaza that captured the ﬂoodwaters of
the San Juan to form a seasonal lake, its waters lapping at painted carvings
of plumed serpents and shells on the temple façade, making them glisten as
rains began to fall in late spring.26
All that ef fort of monumental construction required sacriﬁces, not just of
labour and resources but of human life. Each major phase of building is
associated with archaeological evidence of ritual killing. Adding together
human remains from the two pyramids and the temple, the victims can be
counted in the hundreds. Their bodies were placed in pits or trenches
arranged symmetrically to deﬁne the ground plan of the ediﬁce that would
rise over them. At the corners of the Sun Pyramid, of ferings of infants were
found; under the Moon Pyramid, foreign captives, some decapitated or
otherwise mutilated; and in the foundations of the T emple of the Feathered
Serpent lay the corpses of male warriors, arms tied back at point of death,
buried with the tools and trophies of their former trade. Among the bodies
were found obsidian knives and spearheads, trinkets of shell and greenstone
and collars made of human teeth and jawbones (some, as it turns out,
cunningly faked in shell).27
You would think that at this point – around AD 200 – the fate of
Teotihuacan was sealed: its destiny to join the ranks of ‘classic’
Mesoamerican civilizations with their strong traditions of warrioraristocracy and city-states governed by hereditary nobles. What we might
then expect to see next, in the archaeological record, is a concentration of
power around the city’ s focal monuments: the rise of luxurious palaces,
inhabited by rulers who were the font of wealth and privilege, with attached
quarters for elite kinsmen; and the development of monumental art to
glorify their military conquests, the lucrative tribute it generated and their
services to the gods. But the evidence tells a very dif ferent story , because
the citizens of T eotihuacan chose a dif ferent path.
In fact, the entire trajectory of T eotihuacan’ s political development seems
to have gone of f on a remarkable tangent. Instead of building palaces and
elite quarters, the citizens embarked on a remarkable project of urban
renewal, supplying high-quality apartments for nearly all the city’ s
population, regardless of wealth or status.28 Without written sources, we
can’t really say why . Archaeologists are not yet able to distinguish the
precise sequence of events with any conﬁdence. But nobody doubts that
something did happen, and what we will try to do now is sketch out what it
was.
The big turnaround in T eotihuacan’ s fortunes seems to have begun around
AD 300. At that time, or shortly after , the T emple of the Feathered Serpent
was desecrated and its stores of of ferings looted. Not only was it set on ﬁre;
many of the gar goyle-like heads of the Feathered Serpent on its façade were
smashed or ground to a stump. A lar ge-stepped platform was then
constructed to its west, which made what was left of the temple invisible
from its main avenue. If you visit the heavily reconstructed ruins of
Teotihuacan today and wish to see what remains of its goggle-eyed gods
and plumed snakeheads you will have to stand on top of this platform,
which archaeologists call the adosada .29
At this point all new pyramid construction stopped permanently , and
there is no further evidence of ritually sanctioned killing at the established
Pyramids of the Sun and Moon, which remained in use as civic monuments
until around AD 550 – albeit for other , less lethal purposes about which we
know little.30 Instead, what we see after AD 300 is an extraordinary ﬂow of
urban resources into the provision of excellent stone-built housing, not just
for the wealthy or privileged but for the great majority of T eotihuacan’ s
population. These impressive apartments, laid out in regular plots from one
end of the city to the other , were probably not an innovation of this period.Their construction on a city-grid may have begun a century or so earlier , as
did the razing of older and more ramshackle dwellings to make way for
them.31
Archaeologists at ﬁrst considered the masonry apartments to be palaces,
and it is possible that is exactly how they began around AD 200, when the
city seemed set on a course of political centralization. But after AD 300,
when the T emple of the Feathered Serpent was desecrated, their
construction continued apace, until most of the city’ s 100,000 or so
residents were ef fectively living in ‘palatial’, or at least very comfortable,
conditions.32 So what were these apartments like, and what kind of homes
did people make in them?
The evidence suggests we should picture small groups of nuclear
families, living comfortable lives in single-storey buildings, each equipped
with integral drainage facilities and ﬁnely plastered ﬂoors and walls. Each
family seems to have had its own set of rooms within the lar ger apartment
block, complete with private porticoes where light entered the otherwise
windowless rooms. W e can deduce that the average apartment compound
would have housed in total around 100 people, who would have
encountered each other routinely in a central courtyard, which also seems to
have been the focus of domestic rituals, perhaps jointly observed. Most of
these communal spaces were ﬁtted with altars in the standard style of civic
construction (known as talud-tabler o), and the walls were often brightly
painted with murals. Some courtyards had pyramid-shaped shrines,
suggesting this architectural form had taken on new and less exclusive roles
within the city .33
René Millon, the archaeologist responsible for producing the ﬁrst
detailed map of T eotihuacan’ s layout, felt that the apartment compound was
actually invented as a form of social housing, ‘designed for urban life in a
city that was becoming increasingly crowded, perhaps approaching the
chaotic’.34 Each block was initially laid out to similar scale and
dimensions, on plots of roughly 3,600 square metres, although some
deviated from this ideal scheme. Strict uniformity was avoided in the
arrangement of rooms and courtyards, so in the last resort each compound
was unique. Even the more modest apartments show signs of a comfortable
lifestyle, with access to imported goods and a staple diet of corn tortillas,
eggs, turkey and rabbit meat, and the milk-hued drink known as pulque  (an
alcoholic beverage fermented from the spiky agave plant).35In other words, few were deprived. More than that, many citizens
enjoyed a standard of living that is rarely achieved across such a wide
sector of urban society in any period of urban history , including our own.
Teotihuacan had indeed changed its course away from monarchy and
aristocracy to become instead a ‘T ollan of the people’.
But how was this remarkable transformation achieved? Apart from
spoilage of the T emple of the Feathered Serpent, there are few signs of
violence. Land and resources appear to have been allocated to family
groups who became neighbours. In this multi-ethnic city , each co-
residential group of between sixty and 100 people would have enjoyed two
kinds of communal life. One was based on kinship, with family ties
extending far beyond the apartment block and often beyond the city – ties
which could have troublesome implications, as we’ll shortly see. The other
was based more strictly on co-residence in apartments and neighbourhoods,
often reinforced by shared craft specializations such as garment-making or
obsidian-working.
Both forms of urban community , existing alongside one another , retained
a human scale, a world away from our modern conception of the ‘housing
estate’ in which nuclear families are sequestered by the thousands in multi-
storey monoliths. So we are back to the question with which we started:
what held this ‘New T eotihuacan’ together , if not a hereditary elite or some
other type of governing class?
Without written evidence it may never be possible to reconstruct the
details, but by now we can probably rule out any sort of top-down system in
which elite cadres of royal administrators or priests drew up plans and sent
out orders. A more likely possibility is that authority was distributed among
local assemblies, perhaps answerable to a governing council. If any trace of
these community associations survives it is in the district shrines known as
‘three-temple complexes’. At least twenty such complexes were dispersed
throughout the city , serving a total of 2,000 apartments, one for every 100
apartment blocks.36
This might imply the delegation of government to neighbourhood
councils with constituencies similar in size to those of Mesopotamian city-
wards, or the assembly houses of Ukrainian mega-sites we discussed in
Chapter Eight , or for that matter the barrios  of later Mesoamerican towns.
It may seem hard to imagine a city this size running successfully in this way
for centuries without strong leaders or an extensive bureaucracy; but aswe’ll see, ﬁrst-hand accounts of later cities from the time of the Spanish
conquest lend credence to the idea.
Another , more ebullient face of T eotihuacan’ s civic identity is revealed in
its mural art. Despite ef forts to see them as sombre religious iconography ,
these playful pictorial scenes – painted on the interior walls of apartment
compounds from around AD 350 – often seem veritably psychedelic.37
Streaming efﬁgies emer ge from clustered plant, human and animal bodies,
framed by ﬁgures with elaborate costumes, sometimes grasping
hallucinogenic seeds and mushrooms; and among the crowd scenes we ﬁnd
ﬂower eaters with rainbows bursting from their heads.38 Such scenes often
depict human ﬁgures all at roughly the same size, with no individual raised
up over another .39
Of course, these murals represent T eotihuacanos as they liked to imagine
themselves; social realities are always more complex. Archaeological
excavations in a part of the city known as T eopancazco, lying south of the
city centre, show just how complex those realities could actually get. T races
of domestic life in T eopancazco dating to around AD 350 reveal the afﬂuent
life of its inhabitants, whose shell-ornamented cotton dress suggests they
originally came from the Gulf Coast and continued to trade with that region.
From there they also brought with them certain customs, including
unusually violent rituals, which are not so far documented elsewhere in the
city. These seem to have involved the capture and decapitation of foreign
enemies, whose heads were kept and buried in of fering vessels, found
within their private homes.40
Now here we have something going on that would obviously be very
difﬁcult to square with the idea of communal living on a lar ge scale; and
this is precisely our point. Below the surface of civil society at T eotihuacan
there must have been all sorts of social tensions simmering away among
groups of radically dif ferent ethnic and linguistic backgrounds who were
constantly moving in and out, consolidating relationships with foreign
trading partners, cultivating alter egos in remote places and sometimes
bringing those forms of identity back with them. (W e might allow ourselves
to imagine what would happen should a T eotihuacano freebooter who’d
managed to make himself King of T ikal ever have returned home.) By
around AD 550, the social fabric of the city had begun to come apart at the
seams. There is no compelling evidence of foreign invasion. Things seems
to have disintegrated from within. Almost as suddenly as it had oncecoalesced some ﬁve centuries previously , the city’ s population dispersed
again, leaving their T ollan behind them.41
The rise and decline of T eotihuacan set in motion a roughly cyclical
pattern of demographic concentration and dispersal in central Mexico which
repeated itself a number of times between AD 300 and 1200, down to the
disintegration of T ula and the fall of the T oltec state.42 Over this longer
span of time, what was the legacy of T eotihuacan and its grand urban
experiment? Should we view the whole episode as a passing deviation, a
blip (albeit an extremely lar ge blip) on the road that led from Olmec
hierarchy to T oltec aristocracy and eventually Aztec imperialism? Or might
the egalitarian aspects of T eotihuacan have a distinct legacy of their own?
Few have really considered the latter possibility , but there are good reasons
to ask, especially since early Spanish accounts of the Mexican highlands
provide some extraordinarily suggestive material – including descriptions
of indigenous cities which, to European eyes, could only be understood as
republics, or even democracies.
ON THE CASE OF TLAXCALA, AN INDIGENOUS REPUBLIC
THA T RESISTED THE AZTEC EMPIRE THEN CAME T O JOIN
FORCES WITH SP ANISH INV ADERS, AND HOW ITS F ATEFUL
DECISION EMERGED FROM DEMOCRA TIC DELIBERA TIONS
IN AN URBAN P ARLIAMENT (AS OPPOSED T O THE
DAZZLING EFFECTS OF EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY ON
‘INDIAN MINDS’)
With this in mind, let’ s now consider a very dif ferent case of cultural
contact, which takes us forwards in time to the beginnings of European
expansion in the Americas. It concerns an indigenous city-state by the name
of Tlaxcala, adjacent to what’ s now the Mexican state of Puebla, which
played a pivotal role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire or T riple
Alliance. Here is how Charles C. Mann, in his acclaimed 1491: New
Revelations of the Americas befor e Columbus  (2005), describes what
happened in 1519 when Hernán Cortés passed through:
Marching inland from the sea, the Spanish at ﬁrst fought repeatedly
with Tlaxcala, a confederation of four small kingdoms that had
maintained its independence despite repeated Alliance incursions.Thanks to their guns, horses, and steel blades, the foreigners won
every battle, even with Tlaxcala’ s huge numerical advantage. But
Cortés’ s forces shrank with every ﬁght. He was on the ver ge of
losing everything when the four Tlaxcala kings abruptly reversed
course. Concluding from the results of their battles that they could
wipe out the Europeans, though at great cost, the Indian leaders
offered what seemed a win-win deal: they would stop attacking
Cortés, sparing his life, the lives of the surviving Spaniards, and
those of many Indians, if he in return would join with Tlaxcala in a
united assault on the hated T riple Alliance.43
Now there is a basic problem with this account. There were no kings in
Tlaxcala. Therefore, it could not in any sense be described as a
confederation of kingdoms. So how did Mann come to think there were? As
an award-winning science journalist, but not a specialist in the history of
sixteenth-century Mesoamerica, he was at the mercy of secondary sources;
and this, it turns out, is where much of the problem begins.
No doubt Mann must have assumed (as would any reasonable person)
that if Tlaxcala were anything other than a kingdom – say a republic or a
democracy , or even some form of oligarchy – then the secondary literature
would have been full of lively debates about what this implies, not just for
our understanding of the Spanish conquest as a key turning point in modern
world history , but for the development of indigenous societies in
Mesoamerica, or indeed for political theory in general. Oddly , he’d have
been wrong to assume this.44 Finding ourselves in a similar position, we
decided to delve a little deeper . What we found, we must admit, was rather
startling, even to us. Let’ s begin by comparing Mann’ s account to the one
Cortés himself addressed to his king, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V .
In his Five Letters of Relation , written between 1519 and 1526, Hernán
Cortés recounts his entry to the mountain-ringed V alley of Puebla, on the
southern tip of the Mexican altiplano . The valley at that time sheltered
numerous native cities, of which the lar gest included pyramid-studded
Cholula, and also the city of Tlaxcala. It was indeed in Tlaxcala that Cortés
found local allies who fought alongside him, advancing ﬁrst on Cholula and
then going on to defeat the armies of Moctezuma the Y ounger and lay waste
to the Aztec capital of T enochtitlan, in the neighbouring V alley of Mexico.
Cortés estimated the population of Tlaxcala and its rural dependencies at150,000. ‘There is a market in this city ,’ he reported back to Charles V , ‘in
which more than thirty thousand people are occupied in buying and selling,’
and the province ‘contains many wide-spreading fertile valleys all tilled and
sown, no part of it being left wild, and measures some ninety leagues in
circumference’. Also, the ‘order of government so far observed among the
people resembles very much the republics of V enice, Genoa, and Pisa for
there is no supreme overlord.’45
Cortés was a minor aristocrat from a part of Spain where even municipal
councils were still something of a novelty; one might ar gue he had little real
knowledge of republics and therefore would hardly be the most reliable
judge of such matters. Perhaps so; but by 1519 he had considerable
experience in identifying Mesoamerican kings and either recruiting or
neutralizing them, since this is lar gely what he had been doing since his
arrival on the mainland. In Tlaxcala, he couldn’ t ﬁnd any . Instead, after an
initial clash with Tlaxcalteca warriors, he found himself engaged with
representatives of a popular urban council whose every decision had to be
collectively ratiﬁed. Here is where things become decidedly strange, in
terms of how the history of these events has come down to us.
It is worth emphasizing again that we are dealing here with what is, by
most estimations, one of the pivotal episodes of modern world history: the
events leading directly up to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and
a blueprint for subsequent European conquests throughout the Americas.
We assume that nobody – even the most ardent believer in the forces of
technological progress, or ‘guns, germs, and steel’ – would go so far as to
claim that fewer than 1,000 Spaniards could ever have conquered
Tenochtitlan (a highly or ganized city , covering over ﬁve square miles,
containing roughly a quarter of a million people) without the help of these
indigenous allies, who included some 20,000 warriors from Tlaxcala. In
which case, to understand what was really going on it becomes crucial to
understand why the Tlaxcalteca decided to joined forces with Cortés, and
how – with a population of tens of thousands, and no supreme overlord to
govern them – they arrived at a decision to do so.
On the ﬁrst matter , our sources are clear . The Tlaxcalteca were out to
settle old scores. From their perspective, an alliance with Cortés might
bring to a favourable end their struggles against the Aztec T riple Alliance,
and the so-called ‘Flowery W ars’ between the V alleys of Puebla and
Mexico.46 As usual, most of our sources reﬂect the perspective of Aztecelites, who liked to portray Tlaxcala’ s long-standing resistance to their
imperial yoke as something between a game and imperial lar gesse (they
allowed the Tlaxcalteca to remain independent, the Aztecs later insisted to
their Spanish conquerors, because, after all, the empire’ s soldiers needed
somewhere to train; their priests needed a stockyard of human victims for
sacriﬁce to the gods, and so forth). But this was braggadocio. In fact,
Tlaxcala and its Otomí guerrilla units had been holding the Aztecs
successfully at bay for generations. Their resistance was not just military .
Tlaxcalteca cultivated a civic ethos that worked against the emer gence of
ambitious leaders, and hence potential quislings – a counter -example to
Aztec principles of governance.
Here we come to the crux of the problem.
Politically , the Aztec capital of T enochtitlan and the city-state of Tlaxcala
embodied opposite ideals (no less than, say , ancient Sparta and Athens).
Still, little of this history is known, because the story we’ve become used to
telling about the conquest of the Americas is an entirely dif ferent one. The
fall of T enochtitlan in 1521 is often used to illustrate what some feel to be
deeper , underlying currents of change in human societies: the forces that
give history its overall shape and direction. Starting with Alfred Crosby and
Jared Diamond,47 writers in this vein have repeatedly pointed out that the
conquistadors had something akin to manifest destiny on their side. Not the
divinely ordained sort of destiny they envisaged for themselves, but rather
the unstoppable force of an invisible army of Neolithic Old W orld
microbes, marching alongside the Spaniards, carrying waves of smallpox to
decimate indigenous populations, and a Bronze Age legacy of metal
weapons, guns and horses to shock and awe the helpless natives.
We like to tell ourselves that Europeans introduced the Americas not just
to these agents of destruction but also to modern industrial democracy ,
ingredients for which were nowhere to be found there, not even in embryo.
All this supposedly came as a single cultural package: advanced metallur gy,
animal-powered vehicles, alphabetic writing systems and a certain penchant
for freethinking that is seen as necessary for technological progress.
‘Natives’, in contrast, are assumed to have existed in some sort of
alternative, quasi-mystical universe. They could not, by deﬁnition, be
arguing about political constitutions or engaging in processes of sober
deliberation over decisions that changed the course of world history; and if
European observers report them doing so, they must either be mistaken, orwere simply projecting on to ‘Indians’ their own ideas about democratic
governance, even when those ideas were hardly practised in Europe itself.
As we’ve also seen, this way of reading history would have been quite
alien to Enlightenment philosophers, who were more inclined to think their
ideals of freedom and equality owed much to the peoples of the New W orld
and were by no means certain if those ideals were at all compatible with
industrial advance. W e are dealing, again, with powerful modern myths.
Such myths don’ t merely inform what people say: to an even greater extent,
they ensure certain things go unnoticed. Some of the key early sources on
Tlaxcala have never even appeared in translation, and new data emer ging in
recent years has not really been noticed outside specialist circles. Let’ s see
if we can’ t set the record straight.
How , exactly , did the Tlaxcalteca arrive at a decision to ally with Cortés
on the ﬁeld of battle, thereby ensuring the Spaniards’ victory over the Aztec
Empire? It is clear the matter was fraught and deeply divisive (as it was in
other Pueblan cities as well: in Cholula, for example, the same dilemma
occasioned a rupture between the leaders of six calpolli  – urban wards –
three of whom took the others hostage, whereupon the latter absconded to
Tlaxcala).48 In Tlaxcala itself, though, the ar gument took a very dif ferent
form to what happened in Cholula.
Some of the evidence is to be found in Bernal Díaz’ s famous Historia
verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España  (1568), which contains
lengthy passages on the Spaniards’ interactions with warriors and
emissaries from Tlaxcala. Another much-used source is the illustrated
codex known as Historia de Tlaxcala  (1585), by the mestizo historian
Diego Muñoz Camar go; and there are also important writings by the
Francisan friar T oribio of Benavente. But the most detailed source – in our
minds the key one – is a book that is hardly ever cited; in fact, it is hardly
ever read, at least by historians (though specialists in Renaissance
humanism sometimes comment on its literary style). W e are referring to the
unﬁnished Crónica de la Nueva España , composed between 1558 and 1563
by Francisco Cervantes de Salazar , one of the ﬁrst rectors of the University
of Mexico.49
Cervantes de Salazar was born around 1515 in the Spanish city of T oledo
and studied at the prestigious University of Salamanca, where his scholarly
reputation was second to none. After a time in Flanders he became Latin
secretary to the Archbishop of Seville; this gained him entry to the court ofCharles V , where he heard Hernán Cortés relating his experiences of the
New W orld. This young and gifted scholar soon became a devotee of the
conquistador , and within a few years of Cortés’ s death in 1547 Cervantes de
Salazar set sail for Mexico. On arrival, he taught Latin on premises owned
by Cortés’ s son and heir , but soon became a central ﬁgure in the newly
established university while also taking holy orders; he would attempt to
juggle ecclesiastical and scholarly duties for the remainder of his life, with
mixed success.
In 1558 the Municipality of Mexico, composed mainly of ﬁrst-generation
conquistadors or their descendants, was sufﬁciently impressed with
Cervantes de Salazar ’s scholarly abilities to grant him his greatest wish: an
annual stipend of 200 gold pesos to support his composition of a general
history of New Spain, focusing on the themes of discovery and conquest.
This was quite the endorsement and, two years later , Cervantes de Salazar
(already some way into his manuscript) won a further grant, which was
speciﬁcally intended to support a period of ﬁeldwork. He must have visited
Tlaxcala and its environs during that time in order to obtain valuable
historical evidence directly from local caciques who lived through the
conquista , and from their immediate descendants.50
The municipality appears to have kept its appointed chronicler on a tight
leash, demanding three-monthly updates on his manuscript. His last
submission came in 1563, by which time, despite his best ef forts, he was
embroiled in a bitter ecclesiastical dispute that put him on the wrong side of
the General Inquisitor , the powerful Pedro Moya de Contreras. In those
acrimonious years, Cervantes de Salazar saw Martín Cortés and many of his
other close associates variously imprisoned, tortured or exiled as rebels
against the Spanish Crown. Cervantes de Salazar made sufﬁcient
compromises to escape such a fate; but his reputation suf fered, and to this
day he is often regarded as a minor academic source by comparison, say ,
with Bernardino de Sahagún. Ultimately , both scholars’ work would meet a
similar fate, delivered to the imperial councils of the Indies and the
Inquisition in Spain for obligatory censorship of matters relating to
‘idolatrous practices’ (though not, it seems, on matters of indigenous
politics), without allowing any original or copy to remain in circulation.51
The result was that, for a period of centuries, Cervantes de Salazar ’s
Crónica  was ef fectively hiding in plain sight.52 It is lar gely to the
remarkable ef forts of Zelia Maria Magdalena Nuttall (1857–1933) –pioneering archaeologist, anthropologist and ﬁnder of lost codices – that we
owe not just the rediscovery of Cervantes de Salazar ’s unﬁnished Crónica
de la Nueva España , which she identiﬁed in the Biblioteca Nacional in
Madrid in 191 1, but also most of the surviving details of his life and the
circumstances of its composition, which she extracted from the archives of
the town council in the city of Mexico, ﬁnding (to her astonishment) that
less careful historians who went before her had discovered nothing worthy
of note there. It was only in 1914 that the Crónica  saw publication. T o this
day there is still no critical introduction or commentary to guide readers
through its sixteenth-century prose, or point them towards its signiﬁcance as
a record of political af fairs in an indigenous Mesoamerican city .53
Critics have emphasized that Cervantes de Salazar was writing a few
decades after the facts he described, basing his chronicle on earlier accounts
– but this is equally true of other key sources regarding the Spanish
conquest. They also note he wasn’ t a particularly competent ethnographer
in the mould of, say , Sahagún, being more steeped in the works of Horace
and Livy than the indigenous traditions of Mexico. All this may be true, just
as it is true that the literary tradition prevailing at the time tended to invoke
Greek and especially Roman examples at the drop of a hat. Still, the
Crónica  is clearly not some kind of projection of Salazar ’s classical
training. It contains rich descriptions of indigenous ﬁgures and institutions
from the time of the Spanish invasion which bear no resemblance to any
classical sources and which in many cases are corroborated by ﬁrst-hand
accounts. What are not, apparently , in those other accounts are the details
that Cervantes de Salazar provides.
Of special interest to us are those extended sections of the Crónica  that
deal directly with the governing council of Tlaxcala, and its deliberations
over whether to ally with the Spanish invaders. They include lengthy
accounts of speeches and diplomatic gifts going back and forth between
representatives of the Spaniards and their Tlaxcalteca counterparts, whose
oratory in council occasioned much admiration. According to Cervantes de
Salazar , those who spoke for Tlaxcala included elder statesmen – such as
Xicotencatl the Elder , father to the military general also named Xicotencatl
who is still lionized in the state of Tlaxcala to this day54 – but also masters
of commerce, religious experts and the top legal authorities of the time.
What Salazar describes in these remarkable passages is evidently not the
workings of a royal court but of a mature urban parliament, which soughtconsensus for its decisions through reasoned ar gument and lengthy
deliberations – carrying on, when necessary , for weeks at a time.
The key passages are in Book Three. Cortés is still encamped outside the
city with his newfound T otonac allies. Ambassadors move back and forth
between the Spaniards and the Ayuntamiento  (city council) of Tlaxcala,
where deliberations commence. After many welcomes and much kissing of
hands, a lord named Maxixcatzin – well known for his ‘great prudence and
affable conversation’ – gets the ball rolling with an eloquent appeal for the
Tlaxcalteca to follow his lead (indeed, to follow what the gods and
ancestors ordained), and ally with Cortés to rise up against their common
Aztec oppressors. His reasoning is widely accepted in the council, until that
is, Xicotencatl the Elder – by then over 100 years old and almost blind –
intervenes.
A chapter follows, detailing ‘the brave speech that Xicotencatl made,
contradicting Maxixcatzin’. Nothing, he reminds the council, is harder to
resist than an ‘enemy within’, which is what the newcomers will likely
become if welcomed into town. Why , asks Xicotencatl,
… does Maxixcatzin deem these people gods, who seem more like
ravenous monsters thrown up by the intemperate sea to blight us,
gorging themselves on gold, silver , stones, and pearls; sleeping in
their own clothes; and generally acting in the manner of those who
would one day make cruel masters … There are barely enough
chickens, rabbits, or corn-ﬁelds in the entire land to feed their
bottomless appetites, or those of their ravenous ‘deer ’ [the Spanish
horses]. Why would we – who live without servitude, and never
acknowledged a king – spill our blood, only to make ourselves into
slaves?55
Members of the council, we learn, were swayed by Xicotencatl’ s words: ‘a
murmur began among them, speaking with each other , the voices were
rising, each one declaring what he felt.’ The council was divided, and
without consensus. What followed would be familiar to anyone who has
participated in a process of consensus decision-making: when matters seem
to come to loggerheads, rather than putting it to a vote someone proposes a
creative synthesis. T emilotecutl – one of the city’ s four ‘senior justices’ –
stepped in with a cunning plan. T o satisfy both sides of the debate, Cortéswould be invited into the city , but as soon as he entered Tlaxcalteca
territory the city’ s leading general, Xicotencatl the Y ounger , would ambush
him, together with a contingent of Otomí warriors. If the ambush
succeeded, they would be heroes. If it failed, they would blame it on the
uncouth and impulsive Otomí, make their excuses, and ally themselves with
the invaders.
We need not rehearse here the events leading to an alliance between
Tlaxcala and Cortés;56 we have said enough to give the reader a ﬂavour of
our sources concerning the democracy of Tlaxcala, and the facility of its
politicians in reasoned debate. Such accounts have not fared well in the
hands of modern historians. Few would go so far as to suggest that what de
Salazar described never really happened, or was simply his own
imagination of a scene from some ancient Greek agora or Roman senate,
placed into the mouths of ‘Indians’. Y et on those rare occasions when the
Crónica  is considered by scholars today , it is mostly as a contribution to the
literary genre of early Catholic humanism rather than as a source of
historical information about indigenous forms of government – in much the
same way that commentators on the writings of Lahontan never really
concern themselves with what Kandiaronk might actually have ar gued, but
dwell on the possibility that some passages might be inspired by Greek
satirists like Lucian.57
There is a subtle snobbery at play here. It’ s not so much that anyone
denies outright that accounts of deliberative politics reﬂect historical reality;
it’s just that no one seems to ﬁnd this fact particularly interesting. What
seems interesting to historians is invariably the relation of these accounts to
European textual traditions, or European expectations. Much the same
occurs with the treatment of later texts from Tlaxcala: extant, detailed
written records of the proceedings at its municipal council in the decades
following the Spanish conquest, the Tlaxcalan Actas , which afﬁrm at length
both the oratorical skills of indigenous politicians and their facility with
principles of consensus decision-making and reasoned debate.58
You might think all this would be of interest to historians. Instead, what
really seems to strike them as worthy of debate is the degree to which
democratic mores displayed in the texts might be some sort of near -
miraculous adaptation by ‘astute Indians’ to the political expectations of
their European masters: ef fectively some kind of elaborate play-acting.59
Why such historians imagine that a collection of sixteenth-century Spanishfriars, petty aristocrats and soldiers were likely to know anything about
democratic procedure (much less, be impressed by it) is unclear , because
educated opinion in Europe was almost uniformly anti-democratic at the
time. If anyone was learning something new from the encounter , it was
surely the Spaniards.
In the current intellectual climate, to suggest the Tlaxcalteca were
anything but cynics or victims is considered just a tiny bit dangerous: one is
opening oneself up to char ges of naive romanticism.60 In fact, these days
more or less any attempt to suggest that Europeans learned anything at all
of moral or social value from Native American people is likely to be met
with mild derision and accusations of indulging in ‘noble savage’ tropes, or
occasionally almost hysterical condemnation.61
But a strong case can be made that the deliberations recorded in Spanish
sources are exactly what they seem to be – a glimpse into the mechanics of
collective indigenous government – and if these deliberations bear any
superﬁcial resemblance to debates recorded in Thucydides or Xenophon,
this is because, well, there are really only so many ways to conduct a
political debate. At least one Spanish source provides explicit conﬁrmation
in this regard. Here we turn to Friar T oribio of Benavente, called by locals
Motolinía (the ‘afﬂicted one’) for his ragged appearance, a sobriquet he
seems to have happily adopted. It is to Motolinía and his Tlaxcalteca
informants – who included Antonio Xicotencatl, most likely a grandson of
Xicotencatl the Elder – that we owe the Historia de los Indios de la Nueva
España  (1541).62
Motolinía conﬁrms Cortés’ s original observation: that Tlaxcala was
indeed an indigenous republic governed not by a king, nor even by rotating
ofﬁce holders (as at Cholula), but by a council of elected ofﬁcials ( teuctli )
answerable to the citizenry as a whole. Exactly how many sat on the high
council of Tlaxcala is not clear: Spanish sources suggest any number from
ﬁfty to 200. Perhaps it depended on the matter at hand. Neither ,
unfortunately , does he tell us anything in detail about how these individuals
were selected for ofﬁce, or who was eligible (other Pueblan cities, including
royal ones, rotated ofﬁcial duties among representatives of calpolli ). On the
topic of Tlaxcalteca modes of political training and instruction, however ,
Motolinía’ s account comes alive.
Those who aspired to a role on the council of Tlaxcala, far from being
expected to demonstrate personal charisma or the ability to outdo rivals, didso in a spirit of self-deprecation – even shame. They were required to
subordinate themselves to the people of the city . To ensure that this
subordination was no mere show , each was subject to trials, starting with
mandatory exposure to public abuse, regarded as the proper reward of
ambition, and then – with one’ s ego in tatters – a long period of seclusion,
in which the aspiring politician suf fered ordeals of fasting, sleep
deprivation, bloodletting and a strict regime of moral instruction. The
initiation ended with a ‘coming out’ of the newly constituted public servant,
amid feasting and celebration.63
Clearly , taking up ofﬁce in this indigenous democracy required
personality traits very dif ferent to those we take for granted in modern
electoral politics. On this latter point, it is worth recalling that ancient
Greek writers were well aware of the tendency for elections to throw up
charismatic leaders with tyrannical pretensions. This is why they considered
elections an aristocratic mode of political appointment, quite at odds with
democratic principles; and why for much of European history the truly
democratic way of ﬁlling ofﬁces was assumed to be by lottery .
Cortés may have praised Tlaxcala as an agrarian and commercial arcadia
but, as Motolinía explains, when its citizens thought about their own
political values, they actually saw those values as coming from the desert.
Like other Nahuatl speakers, including the Aztecs, Tlaxcalteca liked to
claim they were descended from Chichimec. These were considered the
original hunter -gatherers who lived ascetic lives in deserts and forests,
dwelling in primitive huts, ignorant of village or city life, rejecting corn and
cooked food, bereft of clothing or or ganized religion, and living on wild
things alone.64 The ordeals endured by aspiring councillors in Tlaxcala
were reminders of the need to cultivate Chichimec qualities (ultimately to
be balanced by the T oltec virtues of an urbane warrior; and just where the
correct balance lay was much debated among the Tlaxcalteca).
If all this sounds a little familiar , we must ask ourselves why . The
Spanish friars will no doubt have heard echoes in these tales of Old W orld
tropes for republican virtue – that same atavistic streak running from the
biblical prophets through to Ibn Khaldun, not to mention their own ethic of
world renunciation. The correspondences are so close that one begins to
wonder if, in their auto-ethnography , the Tlaxcalteca in this case actually
did present themselves to Spaniards in terms they knew would be instantly
recognized and understood. Certainly , we know that the citizens of Tlaxcalastaged some remarkable theatrical spectacles for the beneﬁt of their
conquerors, including a 1539 pageant of the Crusader Conquest of
Jerusalem , in which the climax was a mass baptism of (actual) pagans,
dressed up as Moors.65
Spanish observers may even have learned from Tlaxcalteca or Aztec
sources what it means to have once been a ‘noble savage’. Nor can we rule
out the possibility that indigenous Mexican ideas on the subject entered
wider streams of European political thought that gathered force only in the
days of Rousseau, whose State of Nature maps with alarming ﬁdelity on to
Motolinía’ s account of the Chichimec, right down to the ‘primitive hut
dwellings’ in which they were supposed to have lived. Perhaps some of the
seeds of our own evolutionary story about how it all began with simple,
egalitarian hunter -gatherers were sown right there, in the imaginations of
city-dwelling Amerindians.
But we digress.
Amid all this mutual positioning, what can we really conclude about the
political constitution of Tlaxcala at the time of the Spanish conquest? W as it
really a functioning urban democracy and, if so, how many other such
democracies might have existed in the pre-Columbian Americas? Or are we
confronting a mirage, a strategic conjuring of the ‘ideal commonwealth’,
supplied to a receptive audience of millenarian friars? W ere elements of
history and mimesis both at work?
If all we had to go on were written sources, there would always be room
for doubt; but archaeologists conﬁrm that by the fourteenth century AD the
city of Tlaxcala was, in fact, already or ganized on an entirely dif ferent basis
to Tenochtitlan. There is no sign of a palace or central temple, and no major
ball-court (an important setting, recall, for royal ritual in other
Mesoamerican cities). Instead, archaeological survey reveals a cityscape
given over almost entirely to the well-appointed residences of its citizens,
constructed to uniformly high standards around more than twenty district
plazas, all raised up on grand earthen terraces. The lar gest municipal
assemblies were housed in a civic complex called T izatlan, but this was
located outside the city itself, with spaces for public gatherings entered via
broad gateways.66
Modern archaeological investigations thus conﬁrm the existence of an
indigenous republic at Tlaxcala long before Cortés set foot on Mexican soil,
while later written sources leave us in little doubt as to its democraticcredentials. The contrasts with other known Mesoamerican cities of the
time are quite striking – though it should also be said that ﬁfth-century
Athens was something of an outlier , surrounded by petty kingdoms and
oligarchies. Nor should these contrasts be overdrawn. What we have
learned in this chapter is that the political traditions of Tlaxcala are not an
anomaly , but lie in one broad stream of urban development which can be
traced back, in outline, to the experiments in social welfare undertaken
1,000 years earlier at T eotihuacan. Despite Aztec claims to a special
relationship with that abandoned city , Tlaxcala was at least as much a part
of its legacy as the Aztec capital of T enochtitlan – and in most really
signiﬁcant ways, more so.
After all, it was the Aztec rulers of T enochtitlan who ﬁnally broke with
tradition, creating a predatory empire that was in some ways closer to the
dominant European political models of the time, or what has since come to
be known as ‘the state’. In the next chapter , we intend to turn back and
consider this term. What precisely is a state? Does it really mark an entirely
new phase of human history? Is the term even useful any more?1 0
Why the State Has No Origin
The humble beginnings of sover eignty , bureaucracy and politics
The quest for the ‘origins of the state’ is almost as long-standing, and hotly
contested, as the pursuit of the ‘origins of social inequality’ – and in many
ways, it is just as much of a fool’ s errand. It is generally accepted that,
today , pretty much everyone in the world lives under the authority of a
state; likewise, a broad feeling exists that past polities such as Pharaonic
Egypt, Shang China, the Inca Empire or the kingdom of Benin qualify as
states, or at least as ‘early states’. However , with no consensus among
social theorists about what a state actually is, the problem is how to come
up with a deﬁnition that includes all these cases but isn’ t so broad as to be
absolutely meaningless. This has proved surprisingly hard to do.
Our term ‘the state’ only came into common usage in the late sixteenth
century , when it was coined by a French lawyer named Jean Bodin, who
also wrote, among many other things, an inﬂuential treatise on witchcraft,
werewolves and the history of sorcerers. (He is further remembered today
for his profound hatred of women.) But perhaps the ﬁrst to attempt a
systematic deﬁnition was a German philosopher named Rudolf von Ihering,
who, in the late nineteenth century , proposed that a state should be deﬁned
as any institution that claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of coercive
force within a given territory (this deﬁnition has since come to be identiﬁed
with the sociologist Max W eber). On this deﬁnition, a government is a
‘state’ if it lays claim to a certain stretch of land and insists that, within its
borders, it is the only institution whose agents can kill people, beat them up,
cut of f parts of their body or lock them in cages; or , as von Ihering
emphasized, that can decide who else has the right to do so on its behalf.
Von Ihering’ s deﬁnition worked fairly well for modern states. However , it
soon became clear that for most of human history , rulers either didn’ t makesuch grandiose claims – or , if they did, their claims to a monopoly on
coercive force held about the same status as their claims to control the tides
or the weather . To retain von Ihering and W eber’s deﬁnition one would
either have to conclude that, say , Hammurabi’ s Babylon, Socrates’ Athens
or England under W illiam the Conqueror weren’ t states at all – or come up
with a more ﬂexible or nuanced deﬁnition. Marxists of fered one: they
suggested that states make their ﬁrst appearance in history to protect the
power of an emer ging ruling class. As soon as one has a group of people
living routinely of f the labour of another , the ar gument ran, they will
necessarily create an apparatus of rule, ofﬁcially to protect their property
rights, in reality to preserve their advantage (a line of thinking very much in
the tradition of Rousseau). This deﬁnition brought Babylon, Athens and
medieval England back into the fold, but also introduced new conceptual
problems, such as how to deﬁne exploitation. And it was unpalatable to
liberals, ruling out any possibility that the state could ever become a
benevolent institution.
For much of the twentieth century , social scientists preferred to deﬁne a
state in more purely functional terms. As society became more complex,
they ar gued, it was increasingly necessary for people to create top-down
structures of command in order to co-ordinate everything. This same logic
is still followed in essence by most contemporary theorists of social
evolution. Evidence of ‘social complexity’ is automatically treated as
evidence for the existence of some sort of governing apparatus. If one can
speak, say , of a settlement hierarchy with four levels (e.g. cities, towns,
villages, hamlets), and if at least some of those settlements also contained
full-time craft specialists (potters, blacksmiths, monks and nuns,
professional soldiers or musicians), then whatever apparatus administered it
must ipso facto  be a state. And even if that apparatus did not claim a
monopoly of force, or support a class of elites living of f the toil of
benighted labourers, this was inevitably going to happen sooner or later .
This deﬁnition, too, has its advantages, especially when speculating about
very ancient societies, whose nature and or ganization has to be teased out
from fragmentary remains; but its logic is entirely circular . Basically , all it
says is that, since states are complicated, any complicated social
arrangement must therefore be a state.
Actually , almost all these ‘classic’ theoretical formulations of the last
century started of f from exactly this assumption: that any lar ge and complexsociety necessarily required a state. The real bone of contention was, why?
Was it for good practical reasons? Or was it because any such society would
necessarily produce a material surplus, and if there was a material surplus –
like, for instance, all that smoked ﬁsh on the Paciﬁc Northwest Coast – then
there would also, necessarily , be people who managed to grab hold of a
disproportionate share?
As we’ve already seen in Chapter Eight , these assumptions don’ t hold up
particularly well for the earliest cities. Early Uruk, for example, does not
appear to have been a ‘state’ in any meaningful sense of the word; what’ s
more, when top-down rule does emer ge in the region of ancient
Mesopotamia, it’ s not in the ‘complex’ metropolises of the lowland river
valleys, but among the small, ‘heroic’ societies of the surrounding foothills,
which were averse to the very principle of administration and, as a result,
don’t seem to qualify as ‘states’ either . If there is a good ethnographic
parallel for these latter groups it might be the societies of the Northwest
Coast, since there too political leadership lay in the hands of a boastful and
vainglorious warrior aristocracy , competing in extravagant contests over
titles, treasures, the allegiance of commoners and the ownership of slaves.
Recall, here, that Haida, Tlingit and the rest not only lacked anything that
could be called a state apparatus; they lacked any kind of formal
governmental institutions.1
One might then ar gue that ‘states’ ﬁrst emer ged when the two forms of
governance (bureaucratic and heroic) mer ged together . A case could be
made. But equally we might ask if this is really such a signiﬁcant issue in
the ﬁrst place? If it is possible to have monarchs, aristocracies, slavery and
extreme forms of patriarchal domination, even without a state (as it
evidently was); and if it’ s equally possible to maintain complex irrigation
systems, or develop science and abstract philosophy without a state (as it
also appears to be), then what do we actually learn about human history by
establishing that one political entity is what we would like to describe as a
‘state’ and another isn’ t? Are there not more interesting and important
questions we could be asking?
In this chapter we are going to explore the possibility that there are. What
would history look like if – instead of assuming that there must be some
deep internal resemblance between the governments of, say , ancient Egypt
and modern Britain, and our task is therefore to ﬁgure out precisely what it
is – we were to look at the whole problem with new eyes. There is no doubtthat, in most of the areas that saw the rise of cities, powerful kingdoms and
empires also eventually emer ged. What did they have in common? Did
they, in fact, have anything in common? What does their appearance really
tell us about the history of human freedom and equality , or its loss? In what
way, if any , do they mark a fundamental break with what came before?
IN WHICH WE LA Y OUT A THEOR Y CONCERNING THE
THREE ELEMENT ARY FORMS OF DOMINA TION, AND BEGIN
TO EXPLORE ITS IMPLICA TIONS FOR HUMAN HIST ORY
The best way to go about this task, we suggest, is by returning to ﬁrst
principles. W e have already talked about fundamental, even primary , forms
of freedom: the freedom to move; the freedom to disobey orders; the
freedom to reor ganize social relations. Can we speak similarly about
elementary forms of domination?
Recall how Rousseau, in his famous thought experiment, felt that
everything went back to private property , and especially property in land: in
that terrible moment when a man ﬁrst threw up a barrier and said, ‘This
territory is mine, and mine alone’, all subsequent forms of domination – and
therefore, all subsequent catastrophes – became inevitable. As we’ve seen,
this obsession with property rights as the basis of society , and as a
foundation of social power , is a peculiarly W estern phenomenon – indeed, if
‘the W est’ has any real meaning, it would probably refer to that legal and
intellectual tradition which conceives society in those terms. So, to begin a
thought experiment of a slightly dif ferent kind, it might be good to start
right here. What are we really saying when we say that the power of a
feudal aristocracy , or a landed gentry , or absentee landlords is ‘based on
land’?
Often we use such language as a way of cutting through airy abstractions
or high-minded pretensions to address simple material realities. For
example, the two dominant political parties in nineteenth-century England,
the Whigs and the T ories, liked to represent themselves as ar guing about
ideas: a certain conception of free-market liberalism versus a certain notion
of tradition. An historical materialist might object that, in fact, Whigs
represented the interests of the commercial classes, and the T ories those of
the landowners. They are of course right. It would be foolhardy to deny it.
What we might question, however , is the premise that ‘landed’ (or any otherform of) property is itself particularly material. Y es: soil, stones, grass,
hedges, farm buildings and granaries are all material things; but when one
speaks of ‘landed property’ what one is really talking about is an
individual’ s claim to exclusive access and control over all the soil, stones,
grass, hedges, etc. within a speciﬁc territory . In practice, this means a legal
right to keep anyone else of f it. Land is only really ‘yours’, in this sense, if
no one would think to challenge your claim over it, or if you have the
capacity to summon at will people with weapons to threaten or attack
anyone who disagrees, or just enters without permission and refuses to
leave. Even if you shoot the trespassers yourself, you still need others to
agree you were within your rights to do so. In other words, ‘landed
property’ is not actual soil, rocks or grass. It is a legal understanding,
maintained by a subtle mix of morality and the threat of violence. In fact,
land ownership illustrates perfectly the logic of what Rudolf von Ihering
called the state’ s monopoly of violence within a territory – just within a
much smaller territory than a nation state.
All this might sound a little abstract, but it is a simple description of what
happens in reality , as any reader who has ever tried to squat a piece of land,
occupy a building or for that matter overthrow a government will be keenly
aware. Ultimately , everyone knows it all comes down to whether someone
will eventually be given orders to remove you by force, and if it does, then
everything comes down to whether that someone is actually willing to
follow orders. Revolutions are rarely won in open combat. When
revolutionaries win, it’ s usually because the bulk of those sent to crush them
refuse to shoot, or just go home.
So does that mean property , like political power , ultimately derives (as
Chairman Mao so delicately put it) ‘from the barrel of a gun’ – or , at best,
from the ability to command the loyalties of those trained to use them?
No. Or not exactly .
To illustrate why not, and continue our thought experiment, let’ s take a
different sort of property . Consider a diamond necklace. If Kim Kardashian
walks down the street in Paris wearing a diamond necklace worth millions
of dollars, she is not only showing of f her wealth, she is also ﬂaunting her
power over violence, since everyone assumes she would not be able to do
so without the existence, visible or not, of an armed personal security detail,
trained to deal with potential thieves. Property rights of all sorts are
ultimately backed up by what legal theorists like von Iheringeuphemistically called ‘force’. But let us imagine, for a moment, what
would happen if everyone on earth were suddenly to become physically
invulnerable. Say they all drank a potion which made it impossible for
anyone to harm anyone else. Could Kim Kardashian still maintain exclusive
rights over her jewellery?
Well, perhaps not if she showed it of f too regularly , since someone would
presumably snatch it; but she certainly could if she normally kept it hidden
in a safe, the combination of which she alone knew and only revealed to
trusted audiences at events which were not announced in advance. So there
is a second way of ensuring that one has access to rights others do not have:
the control of information. Only Kim and her closest conﬁdants know
where the diamonds are normally kept, or when she is likely to appear
wearing them. This obviously applies to all forms of property that are
ultimately backed up by the ‘threat of force’ – landed property , wares in
stores, and so forth. If humans were incapable of hurting each other , no one
would be able to declare something absolutely sacred to themselves or to
defend it against ‘all the world’. They could only exclude those who agreed
to be excluded.
Still, let us take the experiment a step further and imagine everyone on
earth drank another potion which rendered them all incapable of keeping a
secret, but still unable to harm one another physically as well. Access to
information, as well as force, has now been equalized. Can Kim still keep
her diamonds? Possibly . But only if she manages to convince absolutely
everyone that, being Kim Kardashian, she is such a unique and
extraordinary human being that she actually deserves to have things no one
else can.
We would like to suggest that these three principles – call them control of
violence, control of information, and individual charisma – are also the
three possible bases of social power .2 The threat of violence tends to be the
most dependable, which is why it has become the basis for uniform systems
of law everywhere; charisma tends to be the most ephemeral. Usually , all
three coexist to some degree. Even in societies where interpersonal violence
is rare, one may well ﬁnd hierarchies based on knowledge. It doesn’ t even
particularly matter what that knowledge is about: maybe some sort of
technical know-how (say , of smelting copper , or using herbal medicines); or
maybe something we consider total mumbo jumbo (the names of thetwenty-seven hells and thirty-nine heavens, and what creatures one would
be likely to meet if one travelled there).
Today , it is quite commonplace – for instance, in parts of Africa and
Papua New Guinea – to ﬁnd initiation ceremonies that are so complex as to
require bureaucratic management, where initiates are gradually introduced
to higher and higher levels of arcane knowledge, in societies where there
are otherwise no formal ranks of any sort. Even where such hierarchies of
knowledge do not exist, there will obviously always be individual
differences. Some people will be considered more charming, funny ,
intelligent or physically attractive than others. This will always make some
sort of dif ference, even within groups that develop elaborate safeguards to
ensure that it doesn’ t (as, for instance, with the ritual mockery of successful
hunters among ‘egalitarian’ foragers like the Hadza).
As we’ve noted, an egalitarian ethos can take one of two directions: it
can either deny such individual quirks entirely , and insist that people are (or
at least should be) treated as if they were exactly the same; or it can
celebrate their quirks in such a way as to imply that everyone is so
profoundly dif ferent that any overall ranking would be inconceivable.
(After all, how do you measure the best ﬁsherman against the most
digniﬁed elder , against the person who tells the funniest jokes, and so on?).
In such cases, it might happen that certain ‘extreme individuals’ – if we
may call them that – do gain an outstanding, even leadership role. Here we
might think of Nuer prophets, or certain Amazonian shamans, Malagasy
mpomasy  or astrologer -magicians, or for that matter the ‘rich’ burials of the
Upper Palaeolithic, which so often focus on individuals with strikingly
anomalous physical (and probably other) attributes. As those examples
imply , however , such characters are so highly unusual that it would be
difﬁcult to turn their authority into any sort of ongoing power .
What really concerns us about these three principles is that each has
become the basis for institutions now seen as foundational to the modern
state. In the case of control over violence, this is obvious. Modern states are
‘sovereign’: they hold the power once held by kings, which in practice
translates into von Ihering’ s monopoly on the legitimate use of coercive
force within their territory . In theory , a true sovereign exercised a power
that was above and beyond the law . Ancient kings were rarely able to
enforce this power systematically (often, as we’ve seen, their supposedly
absolute power really just meant they were the only people who could meteout arbitrary violence within about 100 yards of where they were standing
or sitting at any given time). In modern states, the very same kind of power
is multiplied a thousand times because it is combined with the second
principle: bureaucracy . As W eber, the great sociologist of bureaucracy ,
observed long ago, administrative or ganizations are always based not just
on control of information, but also on ‘ofﬁcial secrets’ of one sort or
another . This is why the secret agent has become the mythic symbol of the
modern state. James Bond, with his licence to kill, combines charisma,
secrecy and the power to use unaccountable violence, underpinned by a
great bureaucratic machine.
The combination of sovereignty with sophisticated administrative
techniques for storing and tabulating information introduces all sorts of
threats to individual freedom – it makes possible surveillance states and
totalitarian regimes – but this danger , we are always assured, is of fset by a
third principle: democracy . Modern states are democratic, or at least it’ s
generally felt they really should be. Y et democracy , in modern states, is
conceived very dif ferently to, say , the workings of an assembly in an
ancient city , which collectively deliberated on common problems. Rather ,
democracy as we have come to know it is ef fectively a game of winners and
losers played out among lar ger-than-life individuals, with the rest of us
reduced lar gely to onlookers.
If we are seeking an ancient precedent to this aspect of modern
democracy , we shouldn’ t turn to the assemblies of Athens, Syracuse or
Corinth, but instead – paradoxically – to aristocratic contests of ‘heroic
ages’, such as those described in the Iliad  with its endless agons : races,
duels, games, gifts and sacriﬁces. As we noted in Chapter Nine , the political
philosophers of later Greek cities did not actually consider elections a
democratic way of selecting candidates for public ofﬁce at all. The
democratic method was sortition, or lottery , much like modern jury duty .
Elections were assumed to belong to the aristocratic mode (aristocracy
meaning ‘rule of the best’), allowing commoners – much like the retainers
in an old-fashioned, heroic aristocracy – to decide who among the well born
should be considered best of all; and well born, in this context, simply
meant all those who could af ford to spend much of their time playing at
politics.3
Just as access to violence, information and charisma deﬁnes the very
possibilities of social domination, so the modern state is deﬁned as acombination of sovereignty , bureaucracy and a competitive political ﬁeld.4
It seems only natural, then, that we should examine history in this light too;
but as soon as we try to do so, we realize there is no actual reason why
these three principles should go together , let alone reinforce each other in
the precise fashion we have come to expect from governments today . For
one thing, the three elementary forms of domination have entirely separate
historical origins. W e’ve already seen this in ancient Mesopotamia, where
initially the bureaucratic-commercial societies of the river valleys existed in
tension with the heroic polities of the hills and their endless petty
princelings, vying for the loyalty of retainers through spectacular contests
of one sort or another; while the hill people, in turn, rejected the very
principle of administration.
Nor is there any compelling evidence that ancient Mesopotamian cities,
even when ruled by royal dynasties, achieved any measure of real territorial
sovereignty , so we are still a long way here from anything like an
embryonic version of the modern state.5 In other words, they simply
weren’ t states in von Ihering’ s sense of the term; and even if they had been,
it makes little sense to deﬁne a state simply in terms of sovereignty . Recall
the example of the Natchez of Louisiana, whose Great Sun wielded
absolute power within his own (rather small) Great V illage, where he could
order summary executions and appropriate goods pretty much as he had a
mind to, but whose subjects lar gely ignored him when he wasn’ t around.
The divine kingship of the Shilluk, a Nilotic people of East Africa, worked
on similar lines: there were very few limits on what the king could do to
those in his physical presence, but there was also nothing remotely
resembling an administrative apparatus to translate his sovereign power into
something more stable or extensive: no tax system, no system to enforce
royal orders, or even report on whether or not they had been obeyed.
As we can now begin to see, modern states are, in fact, an amalgam of
elements that happen to have come together at a certain point in human
history – and, ar guably , are now in the process of coming apart again
(consider , for instance, how we currently have planetary bureaucracies,
such as the WT O or IMF , with no corresponding principle of global
sovereignty). When historians, philosophers or political scientists ar gue
about the origin of the state in ancient Peru or China, what they are really
doing is projecting that rather unusual constellation of elements backwards:
typically , by trying to ﬁnd a moment when something like sovereign powercame together with something like an administrative system (the
competitive political ﬁeld is usually considered somewhat optional). What
interests them is precisely how and why these elements came together in the
ﬁrst place.
For instance, a standard story of human political evolution told by earlier
generations of scholars was that states arose from the need to manage
complex irrigation systems, or perhaps just lar ge concentrations of people
and information. This gave rise to top-down power , which in turn came to
be tempered, eventually , by democratic institutions. That would imply a
sequence of development somewhat like this:
As we showed in Chapter Eight , contemporary evidence from ancient
Eurasia now points to a dif ferent pattern, where urban administrative
systems inspire a cultural counter -reaction (a further example of
schismogenesis), in the form of squabbling highland princedoms
(‘barbarians’, from the perspective of the city dwellers),6 which eventually
leads to some of those princes establishing themselves in cities and
systematizing their power:
This may well have happened in some cases – Mesopotamia, for example –
but it seems unlikely to be the only way in which such developments might
culminate in something that (to us at least) resembles a state. In other places
and times – often in moments of crisis – the process may begin with the
elevation to pre-eminent roles of charismatic individuals who inspire their
followers to make a radical break with the past. Eventually , such
ﬁgureheads assume a kind of absolute, cosmic authority , which is ﬁnally
translated into a system of bureaucratic roles and ofﬁces.7 The path then
might look more like this:
What we are challenging here is not any particular formulation, but the
underlying teleology . All these accounts seem to assume that there is onlyone possible end point to this process: that these various types of
domination were somehow bound to come together , sooner or later , in
something like the particular form taken by modern nation states in
America and France at the end of the eighteenth century , a form which was
gradually imposed on the rest of the world after both world wars.
What if this wasn’ t true?
What we are going to do here is to see what happens if we approach the
history of some of the world’ s ﬁrst kingdoms and empires without any such
preconceptions. Along with the origins of the state, we will also be putting
aside such similarly vague and teleological notions as the ‘birth of
civilization’ or the ‘rise of social complexity’ in order to take a closer look
at what actually happened. How did lar ge-scale forms of domination ﬁrst
emer ge, and what did they actually look like? What, if anything, do they
have to do with arrangements that endure to this day?
Let’s start by examining those few cases in the pre-Columbian Americas
which even the greatest sticklers for deﬁnition tend to agree were ‘states’ of
some kind.
ON AZTECS, INCA AND MA YA (AND THEN ALSO SP ANIARDS)
The general consensus is that there were only two unambiguous ‘states’ in
the Americas at the time of the Spanish conquest: the Aztecs and the Inca.
Of course, that is not how the Spanish would have referred to them. Hernán
Cortés, in his letters and communications, wrote of cities, kingdoms and
occasionally republics. He hesitated to refer to the Aztec ruler , Moctezuma,
as an ‘emperor ’ – presumably so as not to risk rufﬂing the feathers of his
own lord, the ‘most Catholic emperor Charles V’. But it would never have
occurred to him to ponder whether any of these kingdoms or cities qualiﬁed
as ‘states’, since the concept barely existed at the time. Nonetheless, this is
the question which has preoccupied modern scholars, so let us consider
each of these polities in turn.
We will begin with an anecdote, recorded in a Spanish source not long
after the conquista , about the raising of children in the Aztec capital of
Tenochtitlan, shortly before it fell to Spanish forces: ‘at birth boys were
given a shield with four arrows. The midwife prayed that they might be
courageous warriors. They were presented four times to the sun and told ofthe uncertainties of life and the need to go to war . Girls, on the other hand,
were given spindles and shuttles as a symbol of their future dedication to
homely tasks.’8 It is hard to say how widespread this practice was, but it
points to something fundamental in Aztec society . Women still occupied
important positions in T enochtitlan as merchants, doctors and priestesses;
but they were excluded from an ascendant class of aristocrats whose power
was based on warfare, predation and tribute. How far back this erosion of
female political power went among the Aztecs is unclear (certain lines of
evidence, such as the obligation for high-ranking advisors at court to take
on the cultic role of Cihuacóatl – or ‘Snake W oman’ – suggest not far at
all). What we do know is that masculinity , often expressed through sexual
violence, became part of the dynamics of imperial expansion.9 Indeed, the
rape and enslavement of conquered women were among the primary
grievances reported to Cortés and his men by Aztec subjects in V eracruz,10
who by 1519 were willing to take their chances with a band of unknown
Spanish freebooters.
Male nobility among the Aztecs or Mexica seem to have viewed life as
an eternal contest, or even conquest – a cultural tendency which they traced
back to their origins as an itinerant community of warriors and colonizers.
Theirs seems to have been a ‘capturing society’ not unlike some of the
other , more recent Amerindian societies we’ve explored, but on an inﬁnitely
greater scale. Enemies taken in war were kept, nurtured to ensure their
vitality – sometimes in luxurious circumstances – but then ﬁnally killed by
ritual specialists to repay a primordial debt of life to the gods, and
presumably for any number of other reasons too. At T enochtitlan’ s Templo
Mayor the result was a veritable industry of pious bloodletting, which some
Spanish observers took as clear proof that the Aztec ruling classes were in
league with Satan.1 1
This is how the Aztecs attempted to impress their neighbours, and it is
still how they impress themselves on the human imagination today: the
image of thousands of prisoners, waiting in line to have their hearts torn out
by masked god-impersonators, is, admittedly , difﬁcult to get out of one’ s
head. In other respects, however , the sixteenth-century Aztecs seemed to the
Spaniards to present a rather familiar picture of human government;
certainly , more familiar than anything they encountered in the Caribbean or
in the swamps and savannahs of Y ucatán. Monarchy , ranks of ofﬁcialdom,
military cadres and or ganized religion (however ‘demonic’) were all highlydeveloped. Urban planning in the V alley of Mexico, as some Spaniards
remarked, seemed superior to what was found in their Castilian cities back
home. Sumptuary laws, no less elaborate than in Spain, kept a respectable
distance between governing and governed, dictating everything from
fashion to sexual mores. T ribute and taxation were overseen by calpixque
who, appointed from among the ranks of commoners, were unable to turn
their knowledge of administration into political power (a preserve of
noblemen and warriors). In the conquered territories local nobles were kept
in place, obedience being assured by a patronage system that tied them to
sponsors at the Aztec court. Here too the Spaniards found resonance with
their practice of aeque principali , which granted autonomy to newly
acquired territories so long as their local headmen supplied annual tithes to
the Crown.12
Like the Spanish Habsbur gs, who became their overlords, the Aztec
warrior aristocracy had risen from relatively humble origins to create one of
the world’ s largest empires. Even their T riple Alliance paled, however ,
when compared with what the conquistadors found in the Peruvian Andes.
In Spain, as in much of Eurasia, mountains of fered refuge from the coercive
power of kings and emperors; rebels, bandits and heretics hid out in the
highlands. But in Inca Peru, everything seemed to work the other way
round. Mountains formed the backbone of imperial power . This upside-
down (to European eyes) political world, conceived atop the Andean
Cordillera, was the super -kingdom of T awantinsuyu, meaning ‘quarters
closely bound’.13
More precisely , Tawantinsuyu refers to the four suyus  or major
administrative units of the Sapa Inca’ s domain. From their capital at Cuzco,
where it was said even grass was made of gold, Inca of royal blood
extracted periodic mit’a –  a rotating labour tribute, or corvée – from some
millions of subjects distributed across the western littoral of South America,
from Quito to Santiago.14 Exercising a degree of sovereignty over eighty
contiguous provinces and countless ethnic groups, by the end of the
ﬁfteenth century the Inca had achieved something like the ‘universal
monarchy’ ( monar chia universalis ) that the Habsbur gs, rulers of numerous
scattered territories, could only conjure in their dreams. Nevertheless, if
Tawantinsuyu is to be considered a state, it was still very much a state in
formation.Just as the popular image of the Aztecs turns on mass carnage, popular
images of the Inca tend to portray them as master administrators: as we’ve
seen, Enlightenment thinkers like Madame de Grafﬁgny and her readers
formed their ﬁrst impression of what a welfare state, or even state
socialism, might be like by contemplating accounts of the empire in the
Andes. In reality , Inca efﬁciency was decidedly uneven. The empire, after
all, was over 2,500 miles long. In villages at any appreciable distance from
Cuzco, Chan Chan or other centres of royal power , the imperial apparatus
made, at best, a sporadic appearance and many villages remained lar gely
self-governing. Chroniclers and ofﬁcials like Juan Polo de Ondegardo y
Zárate were intrigued to discover that while typical Andean villages did
indeed have a complex administrative apparatus, that apparatus appeared to
be entirely home-grown, based on collective associations called ayllu . In
order to accommodate imperial demands for tribute or corvée labour , local
communities had merely tweaked these collectives slightly .15
The imperial centre of the Inca Empire forms a stark contrast with that of
the Aztec. Moctezuma, despite his grandeur (his palace contained
everything from an aviary to quarters for troupes of comic dwarfs), was
ofﬁcially just the tlatoani  or ‘ﬁrst speaker ’ in a council of aristocrats, and
his empire ofﬁcially a T riple Alliance of three cities. For all the bloodthirsty
spectacle, the Aztec Empire was really a confederation of noble families.
Indeed, the spectacle itself seems to have been at least partly rooted in the
same spirit of aristocratic one-upmanship that spurred Aztec nobles to
compete in public ball games, or for that matter philosophical debate. The
Inca, in contrast, insisted their sovereign was himself the incarnate Sun. All
authority derived from a single point of radiance – the person of Sapa Inca
(Unique Inca) himself – cascading downwards through ranks of royal
siblings. The Inca court was an incubator , a hothouse for sovereignty .
Compressed within its walls were not only the household of the living king
and his sister , who was also his Coya  (queen), but also the administrative
heads, chief priests and imperial guard of the kingdom, most of them blood
relatives of the king.
Being a god, the Sapa Inca  never really died. The bodies of former kings
were preserved, wrapped and mummiﬁed, much like the pharaohs of
ancient Egypt; like the pharaohs, too, they held court from beyond the
grave, receiving regular of ferings of food and clothing from their former
rural estates – though unlike the mummiﬁed bodies of Egyptian pharaohs,which at least remained conﬁned to their tombs, their Peruvian equivalents
were wheeled out to attend public events and sponsored festivals.16 (One
reason why each new ruler was obliged to expand the empire was precisely
this: they only inherited the old ruler ’s army . His court, lands and retainers
remained in the dead Inca’ s hands.) This extraordinary concentration of
power around the Inca’ s own body had a ﬂip side: royal authority was
extremely difﬁcult to delegate.
The most important ofﬁcials were ‘honorary Inca’ who, while not
directly related to the sovereign, were allowed to wear the same ear
ornaments and were otherwise seen as an extension of his personage. Statue
doubles or other substitutes might also be employed – there was an
elaborate ritual protocol surrounding these – but to do anything important,
the Sapa Inca’ s personal presence was required, meaning the court was
continually on the move, with the royal person being regularly carried
through the ‘four quarters’ in a litter lined with silver and feathers. This, as
much as the need to carry armies and supplies, required enormous
investment in road systems, converting one of the world’ s most complex
and rugged terrains into a continuous network of well-maintained highways
and stepped paths, punctuated by shrines ( huacas ) and way stations,
stocked and staf fed from the royal cof fers.17 It was on one such annual
tour, far from the walls of Cuzco, that the last Sapa Inca, Atahualpa, was
abducted by Pizarro’ s men and subsequently killed.
As with the Aztecs, consolidation of the Inca’ s empire seems to have
involved a great deal of sexual violence, and resulting changes in gender
roles. In this case, what began as a customary system of marriage became a
template for class domination. T raditionally , in those parts of the Andes
where people were divided by social rank, women were expected to marry
into families of higher status than their own. In doing so the bride’ s lineage
was said to be ‘conquered’ by the groom’ s. What began as a kind of ritual
ﬁgure of speech seems to have been turned into something more literal and
systematic. In each newly conquered territory , the Inca immediately built a
temple and forced a quota of local vir gins to become ‘Brides of the Sun’:
women cut of f from their families, kept either as permanent vir gins or
dedicated to the Sapa Inca, for him to exploit and dispose of as he pleased.
In consequence, the king’ s subjects could be referred to collectively as
‘conquered women’,18 and local nobles jockeyed for position by trying to
place their daughters in prominent roles at court.What, then, of the famous Inca administrative system? It did, certainly ,
exist. Records were kept lar gely in the form of knotted strings called khipu
(or quipu ), described in Pedro Cieza de León’ s Crónica del Perú  (1553):
In each provincial center they had accountants who were called
‘knot-keepers/orderers’ [ khipukamayuqs ], and by means of these
knots they kept the record and account of what had been given in
tribute by those [people] in that district, from the silver , gold,
clothing, herd animals, to the wool and other things down to the
smallest items, and by the same knots they commissioned a record
of what was given over one year , or ten or twenty years and they
kept the accounts so well that they did not lose a pair of sandals.19
Spanish chroniclers provided few details, however , and after the use of
khipu  was ofﬁcially banned in 1583, local specialists had little incentive to
commit their lore to writing. W e don’ t know exactly how it worked,
although new sources of information are still emer ging from remote Andean
communities, where it turns out Inca-style khipus  and their associated forms
of knowledge were kept in use until much more recent times.20 Scholars
argue about whether khipu  should be considered a form of writing. What
sources we do have mainly describe the numerical system, noting the
hierarchical arrangement of colour -coded knots into decimal units, from 1
to 10,000; but it seems the most elaborate string bundles encoded records of
topography and genealogy , and most likely also narratives and songs.21
In many ways, these two great polities – Aztec and Inca – were ideal
targets for conquest. Both were or ganized around easily identiﬁable
capitals, inhabited by easily identiﬁable kings who could be captured or
killed, and surrounded by peoples who were either long accustomed to
obeying orders or , if they had any inclination to shrug of f power from the
centre, were likely to do so precisely by joining forces with would-be
conquistadors. If an empire is based lar gely on military force, it is relatively
easy for a superior force of the same kind to seize control of its territory ,
since if one takes control of that centre – as Cortés did by laying siege to
Tenochtitlan in 1521, or Pizarro by seizing Atahualpa at Cajamarca in 1532
– everything else falls readily into place. There might be stubborn
resistance (the siege of T enochtitlan took over a year of gruelling house-to-
house ﬁghting) but, once it was over , the conquerors could take over manyof the mechanisms of rule that already existed and start conveying orders to
subjects schooled in obedience.
Where there are no such powerful kingdoms – either because they had
never existed, as in much of North America or Amazonia, or because a
population had consciously rejected central government – things could get
decidedly trickier .
A good example of such decentralization is the territory inhabited by
speakers of the various Maya languages: the Y ucatán Peninsula and the
highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas to its south.22 At the time of the
initial Spanish incursion, the region was divided into what seemed to the
settlers an endless succession of tiny principalities, townships, villages and
seasonal hamlets. Conquest was a long and laborious business, and no
sooner was it completed (or at least, no sooner had the Spanish decided it
was completed),23 than the new authorities faced an apparently endless
series of popular revolts.
As early as 1546, a coalition of Maya rebels rose up against Spanish
settlers and, despite brutal reprisals, resistance never really died down.
Prophetic movements brought a second major wave of insurrections in the
eighteenth century; and in 1848, a mass rising almost drove the settlers’
descendants out of Y ucatán entirely , until the siege of their capital, at
Mérida, was interrupted by the planting season. The resulting ‘Caste W ar’,
as it was called, continued for generations. There were still rebels holding
out in parts of Quintana Roo at the time of the Mexican Revolution in the
second decade of the twentieth century; indeed, you could ar gue that the
same rebellion continues, in another form, with the Zapatista movement
that controls lar ge parts of Chiapas today . As the Zapatistas also show , it
was in these territories, where no major state or empire had existed for
centuries, that women came most prominently to the fore in anti-colonial
struggles, both as or ganizers of armed resistance and as defenders of
indigenous tradition.
Now , this anti-authoritarian streak might come as something of a surprise
to those who know the Maya as one of a triumvirate of New W orld
civilizations – Aztecs, Maya, Inca – familiar from books on art history .
Much of the art from what’ s called the Classic Maya period, roughly AD
150–900, is exquisitely beautiful. Most derives from cities that once existed
in what are now the tangled rainforests of Petén. On ﬁrst appraisal, the
Maya in this period seem to have been or ganized into kingdoms much likethose of the Andes or central Mexico, only smaller; but then our picture,
until quite recently , was dominated by sculpted monuments and glyphic
inscriptions commissioned by the ruling elites themselves.24 These focus,
predictably enough, on the deeds of great rulers (holders of the title ajaw ),
especially their conquests, as alliances of independent city-states vied for
hegemony over the lowlands under the leadership of two rival dynasties –
those of T ikal and the ‘snake kings’ of Calakmul.25
These monuments tell us a great deal about the rituals such rulers
conducted to commune with their divinized ancestors26 – but precious little
about what ordinary life was like for their subjects, let alone how those
subjects felt about their rulers’ claims to cosmic power . If there were
prophetic movements or periodic insurrections during the Classic Maya
period, as there were in the colonial period, we would currently have few
ways to know about them; although archaeological research may yet change
this picture. What we do know is that, in the ﬁnal centuries of the Classic
period, women attain a new visibility in sculpture and inscription, appearing
not just as consorts, princesses and queen mothers but also as powerful
rulers and spirit mediums in their own right. W e also know that at some
point in the ninth century the Classic Maya political system came apart, and
most of the great cities were abandoned.
Archaeologists ar gue about what happened. Some theories assume that
popular resistance – some combination of defection, mass movements or
outright rebellion – must have played a part, even if most are
understandably reluctant to draw too ﬁrm a line between cause and
consequence.27 It is signiﬁcant that one of the few urban societies which
endured, even grew , was located in the northern lowlands around the city of
Chichén Itza. Here, kingship seems to have dramatically changed its
character , becoming a more purely ceremonial or even theatrical af fair – so
hedged about by ritual that any serious political intervention was no longer
possible – while day-to-day governance apparently passed lar gely into the
hands of a coalition that formed among collectives of prominent warriors
and priests.28 Indeed, some of what were once assumed to be royal palaces
in this ‘Post-Classic’ period are now being reinterpreted as assembly halls
(popolna ) for local representatives.29
By the time the Spaniards arrived, six centuries after the collapse of cities
in Petén, Mayan societies were thoroughly decentralized, parsed into abewildering variety of townships and principalities, many without kings.30
The books of Chilam Balam , prophetic annals written down in the late
sixteenth century , dwell endlessly on the disasters and miseries that befall
oppressive rulers. In other words, there’ s every reason to believe that the
spirit of rebellion which has marked this particular region can be traced
back to at least the time of Charlemagne (the eighth century AD); and that
across the centuries, overbearing Maya rulers were quite regularly and
repeatedly disposed of.
Undoubtedly , the Classic Maya artistic tradition is magniﬁcent, one of
the greatest the world has ever seen. By comparison, artistic products from
the ‘Post-Classic’ – as the period from roughly AD 900 to 1520 is known –
often seem clumsy and less worthy of appreciation. On the other hand, how
many of us would really prefer to live under the arbitrary power of a petty
warlord who, for all his patronage of ﬁne arts, counts tearing the hearts out
of living human bodies among his most signiﬁcant accomplishments? Of
course, history is not usually thought about in such terms, and it is worth
asking why . Part of the reason is simply the designation ‘Post-Classic’,
which suggests little more than an afterthought. It may seem a trivial issue –
but it matters, because such habits of thought are one reason why periods of
relative freedom and equality tend to get sidelined in the lar ger sweep of
history .
This is important: let’ s look at it further , before we return to our three
forms of domination.
IN WHICH WE OFFER A DIGRESSION ON ‘THE SHAPE OF
TIME’,31 AND SPECIFICALL Y HOW MET APHORS OF
GROWTH AND DECA Y INTRODUCE UNNOTICED POLITICAL
BIASES INT O OUR VIEW OF HIST ORY
History and archaeology abound with terms like ‘post’ and ‘proto’,
‘intermediate’ or even ‘terminal’. T o some degree, these are products of
early-twentieth-century cultural theory . Alfred Kroeber , a pre-eminent
anthropologist of his day , spent decades on a research project aimed at
determining if identiﬁable laws lie behind the rhythms and patterns of
cultural growth and decay: whether systematic relations could be
established between artistic fashions, economic booms and busts, periods of
intellectual creativity and conservatism, and the expansion and collapse ofempires. It was an intriguing question but, after many years, his ultimate
conclusion was: no, there were no such laws. In his Conﬁgurations of
Cultural Gr owth  (1944) Kroeber examined the relation of the arts,
philosophy , science and population across human history and found no
evidence for any consistent pattern; nor has any such pattern been
successfully discerned in those few more recent studies which continue to
plough the same furrow .32
Despite this, when we write about the past today we almost invariably
organize our thinking as if such patterns really did exist. Civilizations are
typically represented either as ﬂower -like – growing, blooming and then
shrivelling up – or else as like some grand building, painstakingly
constructed but prone to sudden ‘collapse’. The latter term tends to be used
indiscriminately for situations like the Classic Maya collapse, which did
indeed involve a rapid abandonment of some hundreds of settlements and
the disappearance of millions of people; but equally it’ s used for the
‘collapse’ of the Egyptian Old Kingdom, where the only thing that really
seems to have declined precipitously is the power of Egypt’ s elites ruling
from the northern city of Memphis.
Even in the Maya case, to describe the entire period between AD 900 and
1520 as ‘Post-Classic’ is to suggest that the only really signiﬁcant thing
about it is the degree to which it can be seen as the waning of a Golden
Age. In a similar way , terms like ‘Proto-palatial Crete’, ‘Predynastic Egypt’
or ‘Formative Peru’ convey a sense of impatience, as if Minoans, Egyptians
or Andean peoples spent centuries doing little but laying the groundwork
for such a Golden Age – and, it is implied, for strong, stable government –
to come about.33 We’ve already seen how this played out in Uruk, where at
least seven centuries of collective self-rule (also termed ‘Predynastic’ in
earlier scholarship) comes to be written of f as a mere prelude to the ‘real’
history of Mesopotamia – which is then presented as a history of
conquerors, dynasts, lawgivers and kings.
Some periods are dismissed as prefaces, others as postfaces. Still others
become ‘intermediary’. The ancient Andes and Mesoamerica are cases in
point, but probably the most familiar – and the most striking – example is
again that of Egypt. Museumgoers will no doubt be familiar with the
division of ancient Egyptian history into Old, Middle and New Kingdoms.
Each is separated by an ‘intermediate’ period, often described as epochs of
‘chaos and cultural degeneration’. In fact, these were simply periods whenthere was no single ruler of Egypt. Authority devolved to local factions or ,
as we will shortly see, changed its nature altogether . Taken together , these
intermediate periods span about a third of Egypt’ s ancient history , down to
the accession of a series of foreign or vassal kings (known simply as the
Late period), and they saw some very signiﬁcant political developments of
their own.
To take just one example, at Thebes between 754 and 525 BC – spanning
the Third Intermediate and Late periods – a series of ﬁve unmarried,
childless princesses (of Libyan and Nubian descent) were elevated to the
position of ‘god’ s wife of Amun’, a title and role which acquired not just
supreme religious, but also great economic and political weight at this time.
In ofﬁcial representations, these women are given ‘throne names’ framed by
cartouches, just like kings, and appear leading royal festivals and making
offerings to the gods.34 They also owned some of the richest estates in
Egypt, including extensive lands and a lar ge staf f of priests and scribes. T o
have a situation in which women not only command power on such a scale,
but in which this power is linked to an ofﬁce reserved explicitly for single
women, is historically unusual. Y et this political innovation is little
discussed, partly because it is already framed within an ‘intermediate’ or
‘late’ period that signals its transitory (or even decadent) nature.35
One might assume the division into Old, Middle and New Kingdoms is
itself very ancient, perhaps going back thousands of years to Greek sources
like the third-century BC Aegyptiaca , composed by Egyptian chronicler
Manetho, or even to the hieroglyphic records themselves. Not so. In fact,
the tripartite division only began to be proposed by modern Egyptologists in
the late nineteenth century , and the terms they introduced (initially ‘Reich’
or ‘empire’, later ‘kingdom’) were explicitly modelled on European nation
states. German, particularly Prussian, scholars played a leading role here.
Their tendency to perceive ancient Egypt’ s past as a series of cyclical
alternations between unity and disintegration clearly echoes the political
concerns of Bismarck’ s Germany , where an authoritarian government was
trying to assemble a uniﬁed nation state from an endless variety of tiny
statelets. After the First W orld W ar, as Europe’ s own regime of old
monarchies was coming apart, prominent Egyptologists such as Adolf
Erman granted the ‘Intermediate’ periods their own place in history ,
drawing comparisons between the end of the Old Kingdom and the
Bolshevik Revolution of their own time.36With hindsight, it’ s easy to see just how much these chronological
schemes reﬂect their authors’ political concerns. Or even, perhaps, a
tendency – when casting their minds back in time – to imagine themselves
either as part of the ruling elite, or as having roles somewhat analogous to
ones they had in their own societies: the Egyptian or Maya equivalents of
museum curators, professors and middle-range functionaries. But why ,
then, have these schemes become ef fectively canonical?
Consider the Middle Kingdom (2055–1650 BC), represented in standard
histories as a time when Egypt moved from the supposed chaos of the First
Intermediate period into a renewed phase of strong and stable government,
bringing with it an artistic and literary renaissance.37 Even if we set aside
the question of just how chaotic the ‘intermediate period’ really was (we’ll
get to that soon), the Middle Kingdom could equally well be represented as
a period of violent disputes over royal succession, crippling taxation, state-
sponsored suppression of ethnic minorities, and the growth of forced labour
to support royal mining expeditions and construction projects – not to
mention the brutal plundering of Egypt’ s southern neighbours for slaves and
gold. However much future Egyptologists would come to appreciate them,
the elegance of Middle Kingdom literature like The Story of Sinuhe  and the
proliferation of Osiris cults likely of fered little solace to the thousands of
military conscripts, forced labourers and persecuted minorities of the time,
many of whose grandparents were living quite peaceful lives in the
preceding ‘dark ages’.
What is true of time, incidentally , is also true of space. For the last 5,000
years of human history – i.e. roughly the span of time we will be moving
around in, over the course of this chapter – our conventional vision of world
history is a chequerboard of cities, empires and kingdoms; but in fact, for
most of this period these were exceptional islands of political hierarchy ,
surrounded by much lar ger territories whose inhabitants, if visible at all to
historians’ eyes, are variously described as ‘tribal confederacies’,
‘amphictyonies’ or (if you’re an anthropologist) ‘segmentary societies’ –
that is, people who systematically avoided ﬁxed, overarching systems of
authority . We know a bit about how such societies worked in parts of
Africa, North America, Central or Southeast Asia and other regions where
such loose and ﬂexible political associations existed into recent times, but
we know frustratingly little of how they operated in periods when these
were by far the world’ s most common forms of government.A truly radical account, perhaps, would retell human history from the
perspective of the times and places in between. In that sense, this chapter is
not truly radical: for the most part, we are telling the same old story; but we
are at least trying to see what happens when we drop the teleological habit
of thought, which makes us scour the ancient world for embryonic versions
of our modern nation states. W e are considering, instead, the possibility that
– when looking at those times and places usually taken to mark ‘the birth of
the state’ – we may in fact be seeing how very dif ferent kinds of power
crystallize, each with its own peculiar mix of violence, knowledge and
charisma: our three elementary forms of domination.
One way to test the value of a new approach is to see if it helps us
explain what had previously seemed anomalous cases: that is, ancient
polities which undeniably mobilized and or ganized enormous numbers of
people, but which don’ t seem to ﬁt any of the usual deﬁnitions of a state.
Certainly , there are plenty of these. Let’ s start with the Olmec, generally
seen as the ﬁrst great Mesoamerican civilization.
ON POLITICS AS SPOR T: THE OLMEC CASE
How precisely to describe the Olmec has proved a difﬁcult problem for
archaeologists to grapple with. Early-twentieth-century scholars referred to
them as an artistic or cultural ‘horizon’, lar gely because it wasn’ t clear how
else to describe a style – easily identiﬁable by certain common types of
pottery , anthropomorphic ﬁgurines and stone sculpture – that seemed to pop
up between 1500 and 1000 BC across an enormous area, straddling the
Isthmus of T ehuantepec and including Guatemala, Honduras and much of
southern Mexico, but whose meaning was otherwise uncertain. Whatever
the Olmec were, they seemed to represent the ‘mother culture’, as it came to
be known, of all later Mesoamerican civilizations, having invented the
region’ s characteristic calendar systems, glyphic writing and even ball
games.38
At the same time, there was no reason to assume the Olmec were a
uniﬁed ethnic or even political group. There was much speculation about
wandering missionaries, trading empires, elite fashion styles and much else
besides. Eventually , archaeologists came to understand that there was, in
fact, an Olmec heartland in the marshlands of V eracruz, where the swamp
cities of San Lorenzo and La V enta arose along the fringes of Mexico’ s GulfCoast. The internal structure of these Olmec cities is still poorly understood.
Most seem to have been centred on ceremonial precincts – of uncertain
layout, but including lar ge earthen pyramid mounds – surrounded by
extensive suburbs. These monumental epicentres stand in relative isolation,
amid an otherwise fragmented and relatively unstructured landscape of
small maize-farming settlements and seasonal forager camps.39
What can we really say , then, about the structure of Olmec society? W e
know it was in no sense egalitarian; there were clearly marked elites. The
pyramids and other monuments suggest that, at least at certain times of
year, these elites had extraordinary resources of skill and labour at their
disposal. In every other respect, though, ties between centre and hinterland
appear to have been surprisingly superﬁcial. The collapse of the ﬁrst great
Olmec city at San Lorenzo, for instance, seems to have had very little
impact on the wider regional economy .40
Any further assessment of Olmec political structure has to reckon with
what many consider its signature achievement: a series of absolutely
colossal sculpted heads. These remarkable objects are free-standing, carved
from tons of basalt, and of a quality comparable with the ﬁnest ancient
Egyptian stonework. Each must have taken untold hours of grinding to
produce. These sculptures appear to be representations of Olmec leaders,
but, intriguingly , they are depicted wearing the leather helmets of ball
players. All the known examples are sufﬁciently similar that each seems to
reﬂect some kind of standard ideal of male beauty; but, at the same time,
each is also dif ferent enough to be seen as a unique portrait of a particular ,
individual champion.41
No doubt there were also actual ball-courts – though these have proved
surprisingly elusive in the archaeological record – and while we obviously
don’t know what kind of game was played, if they were anything like later
Maya and Aztec ball games it likely took place in a long and narrow court,
with two teams from high-ranking families competing for fame and honour
by striking a heavy rubber ball with the hips and buttocks. It seems both
reasonable and logical to conclude that there was a fairly direct relationship
between competitive games and the rise of an Olmec aristocracy .42 Without
written evidence it’ s hard to say much more, but looking a bit closer at later
Mesoamerican ball games might at least give us a sense of how this worked
in practice.Stone ball-courts were common features of Classic Maya cities,
alongside royal residences and pyramid-temples. Some were purely
ceremonial; others were actually used for sport. The chief Maya gods were
themselves ball players. In the K’iche Maya epic Popol V uh a ball game
provides the setting in which mortal heroes and underworld gods collide,
leading to the birth of the Hero T wins Hunahpu and Xbalanque, who go on
to beat the gods at their own deadly game and ascend to take their own
place among the stars.
The fact that the greatest known Maya epic centres on a ball game gives
us a sense of how central the sport was to Maya notions of charisma and
authority . So too, in a more visceral way , does an inscribed staircase built at
Yaxchilán to mark the accession (in AD 752) of what was probably its most
famous king, known as Bird Jaguar the Great. On the central block he
appears as a ball player . Flanked by two dwarf attendants, the king prepares
to strike a huge rubber ball containing the body of a human captive –
bound, broken and bundled – as it tumbles down a ﬂight of stairs. Capturing
high-ranking enemies to be held for ransom or , failing payment, to be killed
at ball games was a major objective of Maya warfare. This particular
unfortunate ﬁgure may be a certain Jewelled Skull, a noble from a rival city ,
whose humiliation was so important to Bird Jaguar that he also made it the
central feature of a carved lintel on a nearby temple.43
In some parts of the Americas, competitive sports served as a substitute
for war . Among the Classic Maya, one was really an extension of the other .
Battles and games formed part of an annual cycle of royal competitions,
played for life and death. Both are recorded on Maya monuments as key
events in the lives of rulers. Most likely , these elite games were also mass
spectacles, cultivating a particular sort of urban public – the sort that
relishes gladiatorial contests, and thereby comes to understand politics in
terms of opposition. Centuries later , Spanish conquistadors described Aztec
versions of the ball game played at T enochtitlan, where players confronted
each other amid racks of human skulls. They reported how reckless
commoners, carried away in the competitive fervour of the tournament,
would sometimes lose all they had or even gamble themselves into
slavery .44 The stakes were so high that, should a player actually send a ball
through one of the stone hoops adorning the side of the court (these were
made so small as to render it nearly impossible; normally the game was
won in other ways), the contest ended immediately , and the player whoperformed the miracle received all the goods wagered, as well as any others
he might care to pillage from the onlookers.45
It is easy to see why the Olmec, with their intense fusion of political
competition and or ganized spectacle, are nowadays seen as cultural
progenitors of later Mesoamerican kingdoms and empires; but there is little
evidence that the Olmec themselves ever created an infrastructure for
dominating a lar ge population. So far as anyone knows, their rulers did not
command a stable military or administrative apparatus that might have
allowed them to extend their power throughout a wider hinterland. Instead,
they presided over a remarkable spread of cultural inﬂuence radiating from
ceremonial centres, which may only have been densely occupied on speciﬁc
occasions (such as ritual ball games) scheduled in concert with the demands
of the agricultural calendar , and lar gely empty at other times of year .
In other words, if these were ‘states’ in any sense at all, then they are
probably best deﬁned as seasonal versions of what Clif ford Geertz once
called ‘theatre states’, where or ganized power was realized only
periodically , in grand but ﬂeeting spectacles. Anything we might consider
‘statecraft’, from diplomacy to the stockpiling of resources, existed in order
to facilitate the rituals, rather than the other way round.46
CHA VÍN DE HUÁNT AR – AN ‘EMPIRE’ BUIL T ON IMAGES?
In South America we ﬁnd a somewhat analogous situation. Before the Inca,
a whole series of other societies are identiﬁed tentatively by scholars as
‘states’ or ‘empires’. All these societies occur within the area later
controlled by the Inca: the Peruvian Andes and adjacent coastal drainages.
None used writing, at least in any form we can recognize. Still, from AD 600
onwards many did employ knotted strings for record-keeping, and probably
other forms of notation too.
Monumental centres of some kind were already appearing in the Rio
Supe region in the third millennium BC.47 Later , between 1000 and 200 BC,
a single centre – at Chavín de Huántar , in the northern highlands of Peru –
extended its inﬂuence over a much lar ger area.48 This ‘Chavín horizon’
gave way to three distinct regional cultures. In the central highlands arose a
militarized polity known as W ari. In parallel, on the shores of Lake T iticaca,
a metropolis called T iwanaku – at 420 hectares, roughly twice the size of
Uruk or Mohenjo-daro – took form, using an ingenious system of raisedﬁelds to grow its crops on the freezing heights of the Bolivian altiplano .49
On the north coast of Peru, a third culture, known as Moche, displays
striking funerary evidence of female leadership: lavish tombs of warrior -
priestesses and queens, drenched in gold and ﬂanked by human sacriﬁces.50
The ﬁrst Europeans to study these civilizations, in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries, assumed that any city or set of cities with
monumental art and architecture, exerting its ‘inﬂuence’ over a surrounding
region, must be the capitals of states or empires (they also assumed – just as
wrongly , it turns out – that all the rulers were male). As with the Olmec, a
surprisingly lar ge proportion of that inﬂuence seems to have come in the
form of images – distributed, in the Andean case, on small ceramic vessels,
objects of personal adornment and textiles – rather than in the spread of
administrative, military or commercial institutions and their associated
technologies.
Consider Chavín de Huántar itself, located high in the Mosna valley of
the Peruvian Andes. Archaeologists once believed it to have been the core
of a pre-Inca empire in the ﬁrst millennium BC: a state controlling a
hinterland that stretched to the Amazonian rainforest to the east and the
Paciﬁc Coast to the west, and included all the intervening highlands and
coastal drainages in between. Such power seemed commensurate with the
scale and sophistication of Chavín’ s cut-stone architecture, its unrivalled
abundance of monumental sculpture, and the appearance of Chavín motifs
on pottery , jewellery and textiles across the wider region. But was Chavín
really some kind of ‘Rome of the Andes’?
In fact, little evidence has emer ged since to suggest this. In order to get a
sense of what might really have been going on at Chavín we must look
more closely at the sort of images we’re talking about, and what they tell us
about the wider importance of vision and knowledge in Chavín notions of
power .
The art of Chavín is not made up of pictures, still less pictorial narratives
– at least, not in any intuitively recognizable sense. Neither does it appear to
be a pictographic writing system. This is one reason why we can be fairly
certain we are not dealing with an actual empire. Real empires tend to
favour styles of ﬁgural art that are both very lar ge but also very simple, so
their meaning can be easily understood by anyone they wish to impress. If
an Achaemenid Persian emperor carved his likeness into the side of a
mountain, he did it in such a way that anyone, even an ambassador fromlands as yet unknown to him (or an antiquarian of some remote future age),
would be able to recognize that it is indeed the image of a very great king.
Chavín images, by contrast, are not for the uninitiated. Crested eagles
curl in on themselves, vanishing into a maze of ornament; human faces
grow snake-like fangs, or contort into a feline grimace. No doubt other
ﬁgures escape our attention altogether . Only after some study do even the
most elementary forms reveal themselves to the untrained eye. W ith due
attention, we can eventually begin to tease out recurrent images of tropical
forest animals – jaguars, snakes, caimans – but just as the eye attunes to
them they slip back from our ﬁeld of vision, winding in and out of each
other ’s bodies or mer ging into complex patterns.51
Some of these images are described by scholars as ‘monsters’, but they
have nothing in common with the simple composite ﬁgures of ancient
Greek vases or Mesopotamian sculpture – centaurs, grifﬁns and the like – or
their Moche equivalents. W e are in another kind of visual universe
altogether . It is the realm of the shape-shifter , where no body is ever quite
stable or complete, and diligent mental training is required to tease out
structure from what at ﬁrst seems to be visual mayhem. One reason why we
can say any of this with a degree of conﬁdence is because the arts of Chavín
appear to be an early (and monumental) manifestation of a much wider
Amerindian tradition, in which images are not meant to illustrate or
represent, but instead serve as visual cues for extraordinary feats of
memory .
Up until recent times, a great many indigenous societies were still using
systems of broadly similar kinds to transmit esoteric knowledge of ritual
formulae, genealogies or records of shamanic journeys to the world of
chthonic spirits and animal familiars.52 In Eurasia, similar techniques were
developed in the ancient ‘arts of memory’, where those trying to memorize
stories, speeches, lists or similar material would each have a familiar
‘memory palace’. This consisted of a mental pathway or room in which a
series of striking images could be arranged, each a cue to a particular
episode, incident or name. One can only imagine what might happen if
someone were to draw or carve one such set of visual cues, and a later
archaeologist or art historian were to discover it, with no idea of the
context, let alone what the story being memorized was actually about.
In the case of Chavín, we actually can be on fairly safe ground in
assuming that these images were records of shamanic journeys; not justbecause of the peculiar nature of the images themselves, but also because of
a wealth of circumstantial evidence relating to altered states of
consciousness. At Chavín itself, snuf f spoons, small ornate mortars and
bone pipes have been found; and among its carved images are sculpted
male ﬁgures with fangs and snake headdresses holding aloft the stalk of the
San Pedro cactus. This plant is the basis of Huachuma , a mescaline-based
infusion still made in the region today which induces psychoactive visions.
Other carved ﬁgures, all of them apparently male, are surrounded by images
of vilca leaves ( Anadenanthera sp. ), which contain a powerful
hallucinogen. Released when the leaves are ground up and snorted, it
induces a gush of mucus from the nose, as faithfully depicted on sculpted
heads that line the walls of Chavín’ s major temples.53
In fact, nothing in Chavín’ s monumental landscape really seems
concerned with secular government at all. There are no obvious military
fortiﬁcations or administrative quarters. Almost everything, on the other
hand, seems to have something to do with ritual performance and the
revelation or concealment of esoteric knowledge.54 Intriguingly , this is
exactly what indigenous informants were still telling Spanish soldiers and
chroniclers who arrived at the site in the seventeenth century . For as long as
anyone could remember , they said, Chavín had been a place of pilgrimage
but also one of supernatural danger , on which the heads of important
families conver ged from dif ferent parts of the country to seek visions and
oracles: the ‘speech of the stones’. Despite initial scepticism, archaeologists
have gradually come round to accepting that they were right.55
It’s not just the evidence for ritual and altered states of mind, but also the
extraordinary architecture of the place. The temples at Chavín contain stone
labyrinths and hanging staircases which seem designed not for communal
acts of worship but for individual trials, initiations and vision quests. They
imply tortuous journeys ending at narrow corridors, lar ge enough for only a
single person, beyond which lies a tiny sanctum containing a monolith,
carved with dense tangles of images. The most famous such monument, a
stela called ‘El Lanzón’ (‘the lance’), is a shaft of granite over thirteen feet
tall, around which the Old T emple of Chavín was constructed. A well-lit
replica of the stela, often assumed to represent a god who is also the axis
mundi , or a central pillar connecting the polar ends of a shamanic universe,
has pride of place in Peru’ s Museo de la Nación; but the 3,000-year -old
original still resides at the heart of a darkened maze, illuminated by thinslats, where no single viewer could ever grasp the totality of its form or
meaning.56
If Chavín – a remote precursor to the Inca – was an ‘empire’, it was one
built on images linked to esoteric knowledge. Olmec was, on the other
hand, an ‘empire’ built on spectacle, competition and the personal attributes
of political leaders. Clearly , our use of the term ‘empire’ here is about as
loose as it could possibly be. Neither was remotely similar to, say , the
Roman or Han, or indeed the Inca and Aztec Empires. Nor do they fulﬁl
any of the important criteria for ‘statehood’ – at least not on most standard
sociological deﬁnitions (monopoly of violence, levels of administrative
hierarchy , and so forth). The usual recourse is to describe such regimes
instead as ‘complex chiefdoms’, but this too seems hopelessly inadequate –
a shorthand way of saying, ‘looks somewhat like a state, but it isn’ t one’.
This tells us precisely nothing.
What makes more sense, we suggest, is to look at these otherwise
puzzling cases through the lens of our three elementary principles of
domination – control of violence (or sovereignty), control of knowledge,
and charismatic politics – outlined at the start of the chapter . In doing so,
we can see how each stresses a particular form of domination to an
exceptional degree and develops it on an unusually lar ge scale. Let’ s give it
a go.
First, in the case of Chavín, power over a lar ge and dispersed population
was clearly about retaining control over certain kinds of knowledge:
something perhaps not that far removed from the idea of ‘state secrets’
found in later bureaucratic regimes, although the content was obviously
very dif ferent, and there was little in the way of military force to back it up.
In the Olmec tradition, power involved certain formalized ways of
competing for personal recognition, in an atmosphere of play laced with
risk: a prime example of a lar ge-scale, competitive political ﬁeld, but again
in the absence of territorial sovereignty or an administrative apparatus. No
doubt there was a certain degree of personal charisma and jockeying at
Chavín; no doubt among the Olmec, too, some obtained inﬂuence by their
command of arcane knowledge; but neither case gives us reason to think
anyone was asserting a strong principle of sovereignty .
We’ll refer to these as ‘ﬁrst-order regimes’ because they seem to be
organized around one of the three elementary forms of domination(knowledge-control, for Chavín; charismatic politics for Olmec), to the
relative neglect of the other two. The obvious next question, then, is
whether examples of the third possible variant can also be found: i.e. cases
of societies which develop a principle of sovereignty (that is, grant an
individual or small group a monopoly on the right to use violence with
impunity), and take it to extreme lengths, without either an apparatus for
controlling knowledge or any sort of competitive political ﬁeld. In fact,
there are quite a lot of examples. Admittedly , the existence of such a society
would probably be more difﬁcult to establish from archaeological evidence
alone, but to illustrate this third variant we can turn, fortunately , to more
recent Amerindian societies where written documentation is available.
As always, we must be careful with such sources, since they are written
by European observers who not only brought their own biases but tended to
describe societies already enmeshed in the chaotic destruction that
Europeans themselves almost invariably brought in their wake. Still, French
accounts of the Natchez of southern Louisiana in the eighteenth century
seem to describe exactly the sort of arrangement we are interested in. By
general consent, the Natchez (who called themselves Théoloël , or ‘People
of the Sun’) represent the only undisputed case of divine kingship north of
the Rio Grande. Their ruler enjoyed an absolute power of command that
would have satisﬁed a Sapa Inca or Egyptian pharaoh; but they had a
minimal bureaucracy , and nothing like a competitive political ﬁeld. As far
as we know it has never occurred to anyone to refer to this arrangement as a
‘state’.
ON SOVEREIGNTY WITHOUT ‘THE ST ATE’
Let us turn to the work of a French Jesuit, Father Maturin Le Petit, who
gave an account of the Natchez in the early eighteenth century . Le Petit
found the Natchez to be nothing like the people Jesuits had encountered in
what is now Canada. He was especially struck by their religious practices.
These revolved around a settlement all the French sources refer to as the
Great V illage, which centred on two great earthen platforms separated by a
plaza. On one platform was a temple; on the other a kind of palace, the
house of a ruler called the Great Sun, lar ge enough to contain up to 4,000
people, roughly the size of the entire Natchez population at the time.The temple, in which an eternal ﬁre burned, was dedicated to the founder
of the royal dynasty . The current ruler , together with his brother (called ‘the
Tattooed Serpent’) and eldest sister (‘the White W oman’), were for their
own parts treated with something that seemed very much like worship.
Anyone who came into their presence was expected to bow and wail, and to
retreat backwards. No one, not even the king’ s wives, was allowed to share
a meal with him; only the most privileged could even see him eat. What this
meant in practice was that members of the royal family lived out their lives
largely within the conﬁnes of the Great V illage itself, rarely venturing
beyond.57 The king himself emer ged mainly during major rituals or times
of war .
Le Petit and other French observers – who at the time lived under the
suzerainty of Louis XIV , who of course also fancied himself a ‘Sun King’ –
were quite fascinated by the parallels: as a result, they described the goings-
on in the Great V illage in some detail. The Natchez Great Sun might not
have had the grandeur of Louis XIV , but what he lacked in that regard he
appeared to make up for in terms of sheer personal power . French observers
were particularly struck by the arbitrary executions of Natchez subjects, the
property conﬁscations and the way in which, at royal funerals, court
retainers would – often, apparently , quite willingly – of fer themselves up to
be strangled to accompany the Great Sun and his closest family members in
death. Those sacriﬁced on such occasions consisted lar gely of people who
were, up to that point, immediately responsible for the king’ s care and his
physical needs – including his wives, who were invariably commoners (the
Natchez were matrilineal, so it was the White W oman’ s children that
succeeded to the throne). Many , according to French accounts, went to their
deaths voluntarily , even joyfully . One wife remarked how she dreamed of
ﬁnally being able to share a meal with her husband, in another world.
One paradoxical outcome of these arrangements was that, for most of the
year, the Great V illage was lar gely depopulated. As noted by another
observer , Father Pierre de Charlevoix, ‘The great V illage of the Natchez is
at present reduced to a very few Cabins. The Reason which I heard for this
is that the Savages, from whom the Great Chief has the Right to take all
they have, get as far away from him as they can; and therefore, many
Villages of this Nation have been formed at some Distance from this.’58
Away from the Great V illage, ordinary Natchez appear to have led very
different lives, often showing blissful disregard for the wishes of theirostensible rulers. They conducted their own independent commercial and
military ventures, and sometimes ﬂatly refused royal commands conveyed
by the Great Sun’ s emissaries or relatives. Archaeological surveys of the
Natchez Bluf fs region bear this out, showing that the eighteenth-century
‘kingdom’ in fact comprised semi-autonomous districts, including many
settlements that were both lar ger and wealthier in trade goods than the Great
Village itself.59
How exactly are we to understand this situation? It might seem
paradoxical – but historically such arrangements are not particularly
unusual. The Great Sun was a sovereign in the classical sense of the term,
which is to say he embodied a principle that was seen as higher than law .
Therefore no law applied to him. This is a very common bit of
cosmological reasoning that we ﬁnd, in some form or another , almost
anywhere from Bologna to Mbanza Congo. Just as gods (or God) are not
seen as bound by morality – since only a principle existing beyond good
and evil could have created good and evil to begin with – so ‘divine kings’
cannot be judged in human terms; behaving in arbitrarily violent ways to
anyone around them is itself proof of their transcendent status. Y et at the
same time, they are expected to be creators and enforcers of systems of
justice. Such with the Natchez too. The Great Sun was said to be descended
from a child of the Sun who came to earth bearing a universal code of laws,
among the most prominent of which were proscriptions against theft and
murder . Yet the Great Sun himself ostentatiously violated those laws on a
regular basis, as if to prove his identiﬁcation with a principle prior to law
and, therefore, able to create it.
The problem with this sort of power (at least, from the sovereign’ s
vantage point) is that it tends to be intensely personal. It is almost
impossible to delegate. The king’ s sovereignty extends about as far as the
king himself can walk, reach, see or be carried. W ithin that circle it is
absolute. Outside it, it attenuates rapidly . As a result, in the absence of an
administrative system (and the Natchez king had only a handful of
assistants), claims to labour , tribute or obedience could, if considered
odious, be simply ignored. Even the ‘absolutist’ monarchs of the
Renaissance, like Henry VIII or Louis XIV , had a great deal of trouble
delegating their authority – that is, convincing their subjects to treat royal
representatives as deserving anything like the same deference and
obedience due to the king himself. Even if one does develop anadministrative apparatus (as they of course did), there is the additional
problem of how to get the administrators actually to do what they’re told –
and, by the same token, how to get anyone to tell you if they aren’ t. As late
as the 1780s, as Max W eber liked to point out, Frederick the Great of
Prussia found that his repeated ef forts to free the country’ s serfs came to
nothing because bureaucrats would simply ignore the decrees or , if
challenged by his legates, insisted the words of the decree should be
interpreted as saying the exact opposite of what was obviously intended.60
In this sense, French observers were not entirely of f the mark: the
Natchez court really could be considered a sort of hyper -concentrated
version of V ersailles. On the one hand, the Great Sun’ s power in his
immediate presence was even more absolute (Louis could not actually snap
his ﬁngers and order someone executed on the spot); while on the other , his
ability to extend that power was even more restricted (Louis did, after all,
have an administration at his disposal, though a fairly limited one compared
to modern nation states). Natchez sovereignty was, ef fectively , bottled up.
There was even a suggestion that this power , and particularly its benevolent
aspect, was in some way dependent on being bottled up. According to one
account, the main ritual role of the king was to seek blessings for his people
– health, fertility , prosperity – from the original lawgiver , a being who in his
lifetime was so terrifying and destructive that he eventually agreed to be
turned into a stone statue and hidden in a temple where no one would see
him.61 In a similar way , the king was sacred, and could be a conduit for
such blessings, precisely insofar as he could be contained.
The Natchez case illustrates, with unusual clarity , a more general
principle whereby the containment of kings becomes one of the keys to
their ritual power . Sovereignty always represents itself as a symbolic break
with the moral order; this is why kings so often commit some kind of
outrage to establish themselves, massacring their brothers, marrying their
sisters, desecrating the bones of their ancestors or , in some documented
cases, literally standing outside their palace and gunning down random
passers-by .62 Yet that very act establishes the king as potential lawmaker
and high tribunal, in much the same way that ‘High Gods’ are so often
represented as both throwing random bolts of lightning, and standing in
judgment over the moral acts of human beings.
People have an unfortunate tendency to see the successful prosecution of
arbitrary violence as in some sense divine, or at least to identify it withsome kind of transcendental power . We might not fall on our knees before
any thug or bully who manages to wreak havoc with impunity (at least, if he
isn’t actually in the room), but insofar as such a ﬁgure does manage to
establish themselves as genuinely standing above the law – in other words,
as sacred or set apart – another apparently universal principle kicks in: in
order to keep him apart from the muck and mire of ordinary human life, that
same ﬁgure becomes surrounded with restrictions. V iolent men generally
insist on tokens of respect, but tokens of respect taken to the cosmological
level – ‘not to touch the earth’, ‘not to see the sun’ – tend to become severe
limits on one’ s freedom to act, violently or indeed in most other ways.63
For most of history , this was the internal dynamic of sovereignty . Rulers
would try to establish the arbitrary nature of their power; their subjects,
insofar as they were not simply avoiding the kings entirely , would try to
surround the godlike personages of those rulers with an endless maze of
ritual restrictions, so elaborate that the rulers ended up, ef fectively ,
imprisoned in their palaces – or even, as in some of the cases of ‘divine
kingship’ ﬁrst made famous by Sir James Frazer ’s The Golden Bough ,
facing ritual death themselves.
So far , then, we have seen how each of the three principles we began with –
violence, knowledge and charisma – could, in ﬁrst-order regimes, become
the basis for political structures which, in some ways, resemble what we
think of as a state, but in others clearly don’ t. None could in any sense be
described as ‘egalitarian’ societies – they were all or ganized around a very
clearly demarcated elite – but at the same time, it’ s not at all clear how far
the existence of such elites restricted the basic freedoms we described in
earlier chapters. There is little reason to believe, for instance, that such
regimes did much to impair freedom of movement: Natchez subjects
seemed to have faced little opposition if they chose simply to move away
from the proximity of the Great Sun, which they generally did. Neither do
we ﬁnd any clear sense of the giving or taking of orders, except in the
sovereign’ s immediate (and decidedly limited) ambit.
Another instructive case of sovereignty without the state is found in the
recent history of South Sudan, among the Shilluk, a Nilotic people living
alongside the Nuer . To recap, the early-twentieth-century Nuer were a
pastoral society , of the sort often referred to in the anthropological literature
as ‘egalitarian’ (though not, in fact, entirely so), because of their extremedistaste for any situation that might even suggest the giving and taking of
orders. The Shilluk speak a western Nilotic language closely related to
Nuer , and most believe that at some point in the past they were one people.
While the Nuer occupied lands best ﬁt for cattle-grazing, the Shilluk found
themselves living along a fertile stretch of the White Nile, which allowed
them to grow the local grain known as durra, and support dense
populations. However , the Shilluk – unlike the Nuer – had a king. Known
as the reth, this Shilluk monarch could also be seen as embodying
sovereignty in the raw , in much the same way as the Natchez Great Sun.
Both the Great Sun and the Shilluk reth could act with total impunity , but
only towards those in their immediate presence. Each normally resided in
an isolated capital, where he conducted regular rituals to guarantee fertility
and well-being. According to one Italian missionary , writing in the early
twentieth century:
The Reth lives isolated, as a rule, with some of his wives in the
small but famous hill-village of Pacooda, known as Fashoda … His
person is sacred and can be approached only with difﬁculty by
ordinary people, and only with elaborate etiquette by the higher
class. His appearance among the people, as for a journey , is rare and
awe-inspiring, so that most people used to go into hiding or keep out
of his path; girls especially do so.64
The latter presumably for fear of being snatched up and carried of f to the
royal harem. Y et to be a royal wife was not without advantages, as the
college of royal wives was ef fectively what substituted for an
administration, maintaining connections between Fashoda and their natal
villages; and it was powerful enough, if the wives came to consensus, to
order the king’ s execution. Then again, the reth also had his henchmen:
often these were orphans, criminals, runaways and other unattached persons
who would gravitate to him. If the king attempted to mediate a local dispute
and one party refused to comply , he would occasionally throw in his lot
with the other side, raid the of fending village and carry of f what cattle and
other things of value his men could get their hands on. The royal treasury
thus consisted almost entirely of wealth that had been stolen, plundered in
raids on foreigners or on the king’ s own subjects.All this might seem a pretty poor model for a free society – but in fact, in
everyday af fairs ordinary Shilluk appear to have maintained the same
ﬁercely independent attitude as Nuer , and to have been just as averse to
taking orders. Even the members of the ‘higher class’ (basically ,
descendants of earlier kings) could expect only a few gestures of deference,
certainly not obedience. An old Shilluk legend sums it up nicely:
There was once a cruel king, who killed many of his subjects, he
even killed women. His subjects were terriﬁed of him. One day , to
demonstrate that his subjects were so afraid they would do anything
he asked, he assembled the Shilluk chiefs and ordered them to wall
him up inside a house with a young girl. Then he ordered them to let
him out again. They didn’ t. So he died.65
If such oral traditions are anything to go on, Shilluk appear to have made a
conscious choice that the sporadic appearance of an arbitrary and
sometimes violent sovereign was preferable to any gentler but more
systematic method of rule. Whenever a reth attempted to set up an
administrative apparatus, even if only to collect tribute from defeated
peoples, his actions were met with overwhelming waves of popular protest
that either forced him to abandon the project or ousted him entirely .66
Unlike the Shilluk reth, Chavín and Olmec elites were able to mobilize
enormous amounts of labour , but it’ s not at all clear if they did so through
chains of command. As we’ve seen in ancient Mesopotamia, corvée or
periodic labour service could also be a festive, public-spirited, even
levelling occasion. (And as we shall see in the case of ancient Egypt, the
most authoritarian regimes still often ensured it continued to have
something of the same spirit.) Lastly , then, we should consider the impact
of such ﬁrst-order regimes on our third basic form of freedom: the freedom
to shift and renegotiate social relations, either seasonally or permanently .
This is, of course, the hardest to assess. Certainly , most of these new forms
of power had a decidedly seasonal element. During certain times of year , as
with the makers of Stonehenge, the entire social apparatus of authority
would dissolve away and ef fectively cease to exist. What seems most
difﬁcult to comprehend is how these strikingly new institutionalarrangements, and the physical infrastructure that sustained them, came into
being in the ﬁrst place.
Who came up with the design for the labyrinthine temple of Chavín de
Huántar , or the royal compounds of La V enta? Insofar as they were
collectively conceived – as they may well have been67 – such grand
fabrications may themselves be considered extraordinary exercises in
human freedom. None of these ﬁrst-order regimes could be considered
examples of state formation – few now would even claim they were. So
let’s turn instead to one of the only cases that pretty much everyone agrees
can be considered a state, and which has served, in many ways, as a
paradigm for all subsequent states: ancient Egypt.
HOW CARING LABOUR, RITUAL KILLING AND ‘TINY
BUBBLES’ ALL CAME T OGETHER IN THE ORIGINS OF
ANCIENT EGYPT
If we had no written accounts to go by , but only the archaeological remains
of the Natchez, would we have any way of knowing that a ﬁgure like the
Great Sun even existed in Natchez society? Conceivably not. W e would
know that there were some fairly lar ge mounds in the Great V illage, built up
in various stages, and no doubt post-holes would provide evidence for some
large wooden structures built on them. Inside those structures, a number of
hearths, refuse pits and scattered artefacts would undoubtedly point to some
of the activities that went on there.68 Perhaps the only compelling evidence
of kingship, though, would come in the form of burials of richly decorated
bodies surrounded by sacriﬁced retainers – if, that is, archaeologists
happened to locate them.69
For some readers, the idea of a dead monarch sent of f to the afterlife
amid the corpses of his retainers might evoke images of early pharaohs.
Some of Egypt’ s earliest known kings, those of the First Dynasty around
3000 BC (who, in fact, were not yet referred to as ‘pharaoh’), were indeed
buried in this way .70 But Egypt is not alone in this respect. Burials of kings
surrounded by dozens, hundreds, on some occasions even thousands of
human victims killed specially for the occasion can be found in almost
every part of the world where monarchies did eventually establish
themselves, from the early dynastic city-state of Ur in Mesopotamia to the
Kerma polity in Nubia to Shang China. There are also credible literarydescriptions from Korea, T ibet, Japan and the Russian steppes. Something
similar seems to have occurred as well in the Moche and W ari societies of
South America, and the Mississippian city of Cahokia.71
We might do well to think a bit more about these mass killings, because
most archaeologists now treat them as one of the more reliable indications
that a process of ‘state formation’ was indeed under way . They follow a
surprisingly consistent pattern. Almost invariably , they mark the ﬁrst few
generations of the founding of a new empire or kingdom, often being
imitated by rivals in other elite households; then the practice gradually
fades away (though sometimes surviving in very attenuated versions, as in
sati or widow-suicide among lar gely kshatriya  – warrior -caste – families in
much of South Asia). In the initial moment, the practice of ritual killing
around a royal burial tends to be spectacular: almost as if the death of a
ruler meant a brief moment when sovereignty broke free of its ritual fetters,
triggering a kind of political supernova that annihilates everything in its
path, including some of the highest and mightiest individuals in the
kingdom.
Often, in that moment, close members of the royal family , high-ranking
military ofﬁcers and government ofﬁcials are counted among the victims.
Of course, if looking at a burial without written records, it’ s often hard to
tell when we’re dealing with the bodies of royal wives, viziers or court
musicians, as opposed to those of war captives, slaves or commoners seized
randomly on the road (as we know was sometimes done in Buganda or
Benin) – or even entire military units (as was sometimes the case in China).
Perhaps, indeed, the individuals named as kings and queens in the famous
Royal T ombs of Ur were not really that at all, but just hapless victims,
substitute ﬁgures or maybe high-ranking priests and priestesses dressed up
as royalty .72
Even if some cases were just a particularly bloody form of costume
drama, others clearly weren’ t, so the question remains: why did early
kingdoms ever do this sort of thing at all? And why did they stop doing it
once their power became more established?
At the Shang capital of Anyang, on the central Chinese Plain, rulers
tended to make their way into the afterlife accompanied by a few important
retainers, who went voluntarily – if not always happily – to their deaths and
were interred with due honours. These were only a small proportion of the
bodies that went with them. It was also a royal prerogative to have one’ stomb surrounded by the bodies of sacriﬁcial victims.73 Often these appear
to be war captives taken from rival lineages and – unlike the retainers –
their bodies were systematically mutilated, usually in mocking
rearrangements of the victims’ heads. For the Shang, this seems to have
been a way of denying their victims the possibility of becoming dynastic
ancestors, thereby rendering the living members of their lineage unable to
take part in the care and feeding of their own dead kin, ordinarily one of the
fundamental duties of family life. Cast adrift, and socially scarred, the
survivors were more likely to fall under the sway of the Shang court. The
ruler became a greater ancestor , in ef fect, by preventing others from
becoming ancestors at all.74
It’s interesting to bear this in mind when we turn to Egypt, because on the
surface what we observe in the earliest dynasties seems the exact opposite.
The ﬁrst Egyptian kings, and at least one queen, are indeed buried
surrounded by sacriﬁcial victims, but those victims seem to have been
drawn almost exclusively from their own inner circles. Our evidence for
this derives from a series of 5,000-year -old burial chambers, looted in
antiquity but still visible near the site of the ancient city of Abydos in the
low desert of southern Egypt. These were the tombs of Egypt’ s First
Dynasty .75 Around each royal tomb lie long rows of subsidiary burials,
numbering in the hundreds, forming a kind of perimeter . Such ‘retainer
burials’ – including royal attendants and courtiers, killed in the prime of life
– were placed in smaller brick compartments of their own, each marked
with a gravestone inscribed with the individual’ s ofﬁcial titles.76 There do
not appear to be any dead captives or enemies among the buried. On the
death of a king, then, his successor appears to have presided instead over
the death of his predecessor ’s courtly entourage, or at least a sizeable
portion of it.
So why all this ritual killing at the birth of the Egyptian state? What was
the actual purpose of subsidiary burials? W as it to protect the dead king
from the living, or the living from the dead king? Why did those sacriﬁced
include so many who had evidently spent their lives caring for the king:
most likely including wives, guards, ofﬁcials, cooks, grooms, entertainers,
palace dwarfs and other servants, grouped by rank around the royal tomb,
according to their roles or occupation? There is a terrible paradox here. On
the one hand, we have a ritual that appears to be the ultimate expression of
love and devotion, as those who on a day-to-day basis made the king intosomething king-like – fed him, clothed him, trimmed his hair , cared for him
in sickness and kept him company when he was lonely – went willingly to
their deaths, to ensure he would continue to be king in the afterlife. At the
same time, these burials are the ultimate demonstration that for a ruler , even
his most intimate subjects could be treated as personal possessions, casually
disposed of like so many blankets, gaming boards or jugs of spelt. Many
have speculated about what it all means. Likely as not, 5,000 years ago,
many of those laying out the bodies wondered too.
Written records from the time don’ t give us much sense of the ofﬁcial
motives, but one thing that’ s quite striking in the evidence we do have –
largely, a list of names and titles – is the very mixed composition of these
royal cemeteries. They seem to include both blood relatives of the early
kings and queens, notably some female members of the royal family , and a
good number of other individuals who were taken in as members of the
royal household owing to their unusual skills or striking personal qualities,
and who thus came to be seen as members of the king’ s extended family .
The violence and shedding of blood that attended these mass funerary
rituals must have gone some way to ef facing those dif ferences, melding
them into a single unit, turning servants into relatives and relatives into
servants. In later times the king’ s close kin represented themselves in
exactly this way , by placing in their tombs some humble replicas of
themselves engaged in acts of menial labour , such as grinding grain or
cooking meals.77
When sovereignty ﬁrst expands to become the general or ganizing
principle of a society , it is by turning violence into kinship. The early ,
spectacular phase of mass killing in both China and Egypt, whatever else it
may be doing, appears to be intended to lay the foundations of what Max
Weber referred to as a ‘patrimonial system’: that is, one in which all the
kings’ subjects are imagined as members of the royal household, at least to
the degree that they are all working to care for the king. T urning erstwhile
strangers into part of the royal household, or denying them their own
ancestors, are thereby ultimately two sides of the same coin.78 Or to put
things another way , a ritual designed to produce kinship becomes a method
of producing kingship.
These extreme forms of ritual killing around royal burials ended fairly
abruptly in the course of Egypt’ s Second Dynasty . However , the patrimonial
polity continued to expand – not so much in the sense of expanding Egypt’ sexternal borders, which were established early on through outward violence
directed at neighbours in Nubia and elsewhere,79 but more in terms of
reshaping the lives of its internal subjects. W ithin a few generations we ﬁnd
the valley and delta of the Nile divided into royal estates, each dedicated to
provisioning the mortuary cults of dif ferent former rulers; and, not long
after that, the foundation of entire ‘workers’ towns’ devoted to the
construction of the pyramids on the Giza Plateau, drawing corvée labour
from up and down the country .80
At this point, with the construction of the great pyramids at Giza, surely
no one could deny that we are in the presence of some sort of state; but the
pyramids, of course, were also tombs. In the case of Egypt, it seems, ‘state
formation’ began with some kind of Natchez or Shilluk-like principle of
individual sovereignty , bursting out of its ritual cages precisely through the
vehicle of the sovereign’ s demise in such a way that royal death ultimately
became the basis for reor ganizing much of human life along the length of
the Nile. T o understand how this could happen, we need to look at what
Egypt was like well before the First Dynasty tombs at Abydos.
Before we consider what happened in the centuries directly preceding
Egypt’ s First Dynasty – the so-called Predynastic and Proto-dynastic
periods, from around 4000 to 3100 BC – it is worth casting our minds back
to an even earlier phase of prehistory in the same region.
Let’s recall that the African Neolithic, including that of the Nile valley –
Egyptian and Sudanese – took a dif ferent form to that of the Middle East. In
the ﬁfth millennium BC, there was less of an emphasis on cereal agriculture
and more on cattle, along with the wide variety of wild and cultivated food
sources typical of the period. Perhaps the best modern comparison we have
– though it’ s very far from exact – is with Nilotic peoples like the Nuer ,
Dinka, Shilluk or Anuak, who grow crops but think of themselves as
pastoralists, shifting back and forth each season between camps improvised
for the occasion. If we might hazard a very broad generalization, where in
the Middle Eastern Neolithic (the Fertile Crescent) the cultural focus – in
the sense of decorative arts, care and attention – was on houses, in Africa it
was on bodies: from very early on we have burials with beautifully worked
objects of personal grooming and highly elaborate sets of body
ornamentation.81It’s no coincidence that many centuries later , when the Egyptian First
Dynasty took form, among the very ﬁrst objects with royal inscriptions we
ﬁnd the ‘ivory comb of King Djet’ and the famous ‘palette of King Narmer ’
(stone palettes being used, both by men and women, for grinding and
mixing make-up). These are basically spectacular versions of the sort of
objects Neolithic Nile dwellers used to beautify themselves millennia
earlier and, not coincidentally , to of fer as gifts to the ancestral dead; and in
Neolithic and Predynastic times, such objects were widely available to
women, men and children. In fact from those very early times, in Nilotic
society the human body itself became a sort of monument. Experiments
with techniques of mummiﬁcation took place long before the First Dynasty;
as early as the Neolithic period, Egyptians were already mixing aromatics
and preservative oils to produce bodies that could last forever and whose
places of burial were the ﬁxed points of reference in an ever -shifting social
landscape.82
How , then, do we get from such a remarkably ﬂuid state of af fairs to the
spectacular appearance of the First Dynasty almost 2,000 years later?
Territorial kingdoms don’ t come out of nowhere.83 Until quite recently , we
had little more than fragmentary hints of what must have been happening
during what are technically referred to as the Predynastic and Proto-
dynastic periods – that is, roughly the fourth millennium, before King
Narmer appears around 3100 BC. In such cases, it is tempting to revert to
analogies with more recent situations. As we’ve seen, modern Nilotic
peoples, and particularly the Shilluk, show how relatively mobile societies
that place great value on individual freedom might, nonetheless, prefer an
arbitrary despot – who could eventually be got rid of – to any more
systematic or pervasive form of rule. This is especially true if, like so many
peoples whose ancestors or ganized their lives around livestock, they tend
toward patriarchal forms of or ganization.84 One could imagine the
prehistoric Nile valley as dominated by a collection of Shilluk-like reths,
each with their own settlement which was, essentially , an extended
patriarchal family; bickering and feuding with one another , but otherwise,
as yet, making fairly little dif ference to the lives of those over whom they
ostensibly ruled.
Still, there is no substitute for actual archaeological evidence – and in
recent years it has been building up apace. New discoveries show that, by
no later than 3500 BC – and so still some ﬁve centuries before the FirstDynasty – we do indeed ﬁnd burials of petty monarchs at various locations
throughout the valley of the Nile, and also down into Nubia. W e don’ t know
any of their names, since writing had barely developed yet. Most of these
kingdoms appear to have been extremely small. The lar gest we know of
centred on Naqada and Abydos, near the great bend of the Nile in Upper
Egypt; on Hierakonpolis further to the south; and on the site of Qustul in
Lower Nubia – but even those do not seem to have controlled extensive
territories.85
What preceded the First Dynasty , then, was not so much a lack of
sovereign power as a superﬂuity of it: a surfeit of tiny kingdoms and
miniature courts, always with a core of blood relatives and a motley
collection of henchmen, wives, servants and assorted hangers-on. Some of
these courts appear to have been quite magniﬁcent in their own way ,
leaving behind lar ge tombs and the bodies of sacriﬁced retainers. The most
spectacular , at Hierakonpolis, includes not only a male dwarf (they seem to
have become a ﬁxture of courtly society very early on), but a signiﬁcant
number of teenage girls, and what seem to be the remains of a private zoo: a
menagerie of exotic animals including two baboons and an African
elephant.86 These kings give every sign of making grandiose, absolute,
cosmological claims; but little sign of maintaining administrative or
military control over their respective territories.
How do we get from here to the massive agrarian bureaucracy of later ,
dynastic times in Egypt? Part of the answer lies in a parallel process of
change that archaeology also allows us to untangle, around the middle of
the fourth millennium BC – we might imagine it as a kind of extended
argument or debate about the responsibilities of the living to the dead. Do
dead kings, like live ones, still need us to take care of them? Is this care
different from the care accorded ordinary ancestors? Do ancestors get
hungry? And if so, what exactly do they eat? For whatever reasons, the
answer that gained traction across the Nile valley around 3500 BC was that
ancestors do indeed get hungry , and what they required was something
which, at that time, can only have been considered a rather exotic and
perhaps luxurious form of food: leavened bread and fermented wheat beer ,
the pot-containers for which now start to become standard ﬁxtures of well-
appointed grave assemblages. It is no coincidence that arable wheat-
farming – though long familiar in the valley and delta of the Nile – wasonly reﬁned and intensiﬁed around this time, at least partly in response to
the new demands of the dead.87
The two processes – agronomic and ceremonial – were mutually
reinforcing, and the social ef fects epochal. In ef fect, they led to the creation
of what might be considered the world’ s ﬁrst peasantry . As in so many parts
of the world initially favoured by Neolithic populations, the periodic
ﬂooding of the Nile had at ﬁrst made permanent division of lands difﬁcult;
quite likely , it was not ecological circumstances but the social requirement
to provide bread and beer on ceremonial occasions that allowed such
divisions to become entrenched. This was not just a matter of access to
sufﬁcient quantities of arable land, but also the means to maintain ploughs
and oxen – another introduction of the late fourth millennium BC. Families
who found themselves unable to command such resources had to obtain
beer and loaves elsewhere, creating networks of obligation and debt. Hence
important class distinctions and dependencies did, in fact, begin to
emer ge,88 as a sizeable sector of Egypt’ s population found itself deprived
of the means to care independently for ancestors.
If any of this seems fanciful, we need only compare what happened with
the extension of Inca sovereignty in Peru. Here, too, we ﬁnd a contrast
between the traditional, varied and ﬂexible regime of everyday foodstuf fs –
in this case centring on cuisine made from freeze-dried potatoes ( chuño ) –
and the introduction of a completely dif ferent sort of food, in this case,
maize beer ( chicha ), which was considered ﬁt for the gods and also
gradually became, as it were, the food of empire.89 By the time of the
Spanish conquest, maize was a ritual necessity for rich and poor alike. Gods
and royal mummies dined on it; armies marched on it; and those too poor to
grow it – or who lived too high up on the altiplano  – had to ﬁnd other ways
of obtaining it, often ending up in debt to the royal estate as a result.90
In the case of Peru, we have the Spanish chroniclers to help us
understand how an intoxicant could gradually become the lifeblood of an
empire; in Egypt, 5,000 years ago, we can really only guess at the details. It
is a remarkable tribute to the discipline of archaeology that we know as
much as we do, and we are starting to put the pieces together . For instance,
it is around 3500 BC that we begin to ﬁnd remains of facilities used for both
baking and brewing – ﬁrst alongside cemeteries, and within a few centuries
attached to palaces and grand tombs.91 A later depiction, from the tomb of
an ofﬁcial called T y, shows how they could have operated, with pot-bakedbread and beer produced by a single process. The gradual extension of royal
authority , and also administrative reach, throughout Egypt began around the
time of the First Dynasty or a little before, with the creation of estates
ostensibly dedicated to or ganizing the provision, not so much of living
kings but of dead ones, and eventually dead royal ofﬁcials too. By the time
of the Great Pyramids ( c.2500 BC), bread and beer were being manufactured
on an industrial scale to supply armies of workers during their seasonal
service on royal construction projects, when they too got to be ‘relatives’ or
at least care-givers of the king, and as such were at least temporarily well
provisioned and well cared for .
The workers’ town at Giza produced some thousands of ceramic moulds.
These were used to make the huge communal loaves known as bedja  bread,
eaten in lar ge groups with copious amounts of meat supplied by royal
livestock pens and washed down with spiced beer .92 The latter was of
special importance for the solidarity of seasonal work crews in Old
Kingdom Egypt. The facts emer ge with disarming simplicity , from grafﬁti
on the reverse sides of building blocks used in the construction of royal
pyramids. ‘Friends of [the king] Menkaure’ reads one such, ‘Drunkards of
Menkaure’ another . These seasonal work units (or phyles , as Egyptologists
call them) seem to have been made up only of men who passed through
special age-grade rituals, and who modelled themselves on the or ganization
of a boat’ s crew .93 Whether such ritual brotherhoods ever took to the water
together isn’ t clear , but there are notable parallels between the team skills
used in maritime engineering and those used in manipulating multi-ton
blocks of limestone and granite for royal pyramid-temples or other such
monuments.94
There may be interesting parallels to explore here with what happened in
the Industrial Revolution, when techniques of discipline, transforming
crews of people into clock-like machines, were ﬁrst pioneered on sailing
ships and only later transferred to the factory ﬂoor . Were ancient Egyptian
boat crews the model for what have been called the world’ s ﬁrst production-
line techniques, creating vast monuments, far more impressive than
anything the world had yet seen, by dividing tasks into an endless variety of
simple, mechanical components: cutting, dragging, hoisting, polishing?
This is how the pyramids were actually built: by rendering subjects into
great social machines, afterwards celebrated by mass conviviality .95We have just described, in broad outline, what’ s widely treated as the
world’ s ﬁrst known example of ‘state formation’. It would be easy to go on
from here to generalize. Perhaps this is what a state actually is: a
combination of exceptional violence and the creation of a complex social
machine, all ostensibly devoted to acts of care and devotion.
There is obviously a paradox here. Caring labour is in a way the very
opposite of mechanical labour: it is about recognizing and understanding
the unique qualities, needs and peculiarities of the cared-for – whether
child, adult, animal or plant – in order to provide what they require to
ﬂourish.96 Caring labour is distinguished by its particularity . If those
institutions we today refer to as ‘states’ really do have any common
features, one must certainly be a tendency to displace this caring impulse on
to abstractions; today this is usually ‘the nation’, however broadly or
narrowly deﬁned. Perhaps this is why it’ s so easy for us to see ancient
Egypt as a prototype for the modern state: here too, popular devotion was
diverted on to grand abstractions, in this case the ruler and the elite dead.
This process is what made it possible for the whole arrangement to be
imagined, simultaneously , as a family and as a machine, in which everyone
(except of course the king) was ultimately interchangeable. From the
seasonal work of tomb-building to the daily servicing of the ruler ’s body
(recall again how the ﬁrst royal inscriptions are found on combs and make-
up palettes), most of human activity was directed upwards, either towards
tending rulers (living and dead) or assisting them with their own task of
feeding and caring for the gods.97 All this activity was seen as generating a
downward ﬂow of divine blessings and protection, which occasionally took
material form in the great feasts of the workers’ towns.
The problems come when we try to take this paradigm and apply it
almost anywhere else. T rue, as we’ve noted, there are some interesting
parallels between Egypt and Peru (all the more remarkable, considering
their strikingly dif ferent topographies – the ﬂat and easily navigable Nile as
against the ‘vertical archipelagos’ of the Andes). These parallels appear in
uncanny details, like the mummiﬁcation of dead rulers and the way in
which such mummiﬁed rulers continue to maintain their own rural estates;
the way living kings are treated as gods who have to make periodic tours of
their domains. Both societies too shared a certain antipathy to urban life.
Their capitals were really ceremonial centres, stages for royal display , with
relatively few permanent residents, and their ruling elites preferred toimagine their subjects as living in a realm of bucolic estates and hunting
grounds.98 But all this only serves to underline the degree to which other
cases referred to in the literature as ‘early states’ were entirely dif ferent.
IN WHICH WE REFLECT ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
WHA T ARE USUALL Y CALLED ‘EARL Y ST ATES’, FROM
CHINA T O MESOAMERICA
The kingdom of Egypt and the Inca Empire demonstrate what can happen
when the principle of sovereignty arms itself with a bureaucracy and
manages to extend itself uniformly across a territory . As a result, they are
very often invoked as primordial examples of state formation, even though
they are dramatically separated in time and space. Almost none of the other
canonical ‘early states’ appear to have taken this approach.
Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, for instance, was made up of dozens of
city-states of varying sizes, each governed by its own charismatic warrior -
king – whose special, individual qualities were said to be recognized by the
gods, and physically marked in the outstanding virility and allure of his
body – all vying constantly for dominance. Only occasionally would one
ruler gain enough of an upper hand to create something that might be
described as the beginnings of a uniﬁed kingdom or empire. It’ s not clear
whether any of these early Mesopotamian rulers actually claimed
‘sovereignty’ – at least in the absolute sense of standing outside the moral
order and thus being able to act with impunity , or to create entirely new
social forms of their own volition. The cities they ostensibly ruled over had
been around for centuries: commercial hubs with strong traditions of self-
governance, each with its own city gods who presided over local systems of
temple administration. Kings, in this case, almost never claimed to be gods
themselves, but rather the gods’ vicegerents, and sometimes heroic
defenders on earth: in short, delegates of sovereign power that resided
properly in heaven.99 The result was a dynamic tension between two
principles which, as we’ve seen, originally arose in opposition to one
another: the administrative order of the river valleys and the heroic,
individualistic politics of the surrounding highlands. Sovereignty , in the last
resort, belonged to the gods alone.100
The Maya lowlands were dif ferent again. T o be a Classic Maya ruler
(ajaw ) was to be a hunter and god-impersonator of the ﬁrst rank, a warriorwhose body , on entering battle or during dance rituals, became host to the
spirit of an ancestral hero, deity or dreamlike monsters. Ajaws  were,
effectively , like tiny squabbling gods. If anything was projected into the
cosmos, in the Classic Maya case, it was precisely the principle of
bureaucracy . Most Mayanists would agree that Classic-period rulers lacked
a sophisticated administrative apparatus, but they imagined the cosmos as
itself a kind of administrative hierarchy , governed by predictable laws:101
an intricate set of celestial or subterranean wheels within wheels, such that
it was possible to establish the exact birth and death dates of major deities
thousands of years in the past (the deity Muwaan Mat, for instance, was
born on 7 December 3121 BC, seven years before the creation of the current
universe), even if it would never occur to them to register the numbers,
wealth, let alone birthdates of their own subjects.102
So do these ‘early states’ have any common features at all? Obviously ,
some basic generalizations can be made. All deployed spectacular violence
at the pinnacle of the system; all ultimately depended on and to some
degree mimicked the patriarchal or ganization of households. In every case,
the apparatus of government stood on top of some kind of division of
society into classes. But as we’ve seen in earlier chapters, these elements
could just as well exist without or prior to the creation of central
government – and even when such government was established, they could
take very dif ferent forms. In Mesopotamian cities, for instance, social class
was often based on land tenure and mercantile wealth. T emples doubled as
city banks and factories. Their gods might only leave the temple grounds on
festive occasions, but priests moved in broader circles, making interest-
bearing loans to traders, watching over armies of female weavers and
jealously guarding their ﬁelds and ﬂocks. There were powerful societies of
merchants. W e know much less about such matters in the Maya lowlands,
but what we do know suggests that power was based less on the control of
land or commerce than on the ability to control ﬂows of people and loyalty
directly , through intermarriage and the intensely personal bonds that
obtained between lords and lesser nobles. Hence the focus, in Classic Maya
politics, on capturing high-status rivals in warfare as a form of ‘human
capital’ (something which hardly features in Mesopotamian sources).103
Looking at China only seems to complicate things even further . In the
time of the late Shang, from 1200 to 1000 BC, Chinese society did share
certain features with the other canonical ‘early states’ but, considered as anintegrated whole, it’ s entirely unique. Like Inca Cuzco, the Shang capital at
Anyang was designed as a ‘pivot of the four quarters’ – a cosmological
anchor for the entire kingdom, laid out as a grand stage for royal ritual. Like
both Cuzco and the Egyptian capital of Memphis (and later Thebes), the
city was suspended between the worlds of the living and the dead, serving
as home to the royal cemeteries and their attached mortuary temples, as
well as a living administration. Its industrial quarters produced enormous
quantities of bronze vessels and jades, the tools used in communing with
ancestors.104 But in most important ways, we ﬁnd little similarity between
the Shang and either Old Kingdom Egypt or Inca Peru. For one thing,
Shang rulers did not claim sovereignty over an extended area. They
couldn’ t travel safely , let alone issue commands, outside a narrow band of
territories clustered on the middle and lower reaches of the Y ellow River ,
not far from the royal court.105 Even there one is left with a sense that they
didn’ t really claim sovereignty in the same sense as Egyptian, Peruvian or
even Mayan rulers. The clearest evidence is the exceptional importance of
divination in the early Chinese state, which stands in striking contrast to
pretty much all the other examples we’ve been looking at.106
Effectively , any royal decision – whether war , alliance, the founding of
new cities, or even such apparently trivial matters as extending royal
hunting grounds – could only proceed if approved by the ultimate
authorities, who were the gods and ancestral spirits; and there was no
absolute assurance that such approval would be forthcoming in any given
case. Shang diviners appealed to gods through the medium of burnt
offerings. The process was as follows: when hosting gods or ancestors at a
ritual meal, kings or their diviners put turtle shells and ox scapulae on the
ﬁre, then ‘read’ the cracks that broke out on their surfaces as a kind of
oracular writing. The proceedings were quite bureaucratic. Once an answer
had been obtained, the diviner or an appointed scribe would then authorize
the reading by etching an inscription on to bone or shell, and the resulting
oracle would be stored for later consultation.107 These oracle texts are the
ﬁrst written inscriptions in China we actually know about, and while it is
very possible that writing was used for everyday purposes on perishable
media that don’ t survive, there remains as yet no clear evidence for the
other forms of administrative activity or archives that became so typical of
later Chinese dynasties, nor much in the way of an elaborate bureaucratic
apparatus at all.108Like the Maya, Shang rulers routinely waged war to acquire stocks of
living human victims for sacriﬁces. Rival courts to the Shang had their own
ancestors, sacriﬁces and diviners, and while they appear to have recognized
the Shang as paramount – especially in ritual contexts – there seemed to be
no contradiction between this and actually going to war with them, if they
felt there was sufﬁcient cause. Such rivalries help explain the lavishness of
Shang funerals and mutilation of captive bodies; their rulers were still in a
sense playing the agonistic games typical of a ‘heroic society’, competing
to outshine and humiliate their rivals. Such a situation is inherently unstable
and eventually one rival dynasty , the W estern Zhou, did manage deﬁnitively
to defeat the Shang, and claimed for itself the Mandate of Heaven.109
At this point it should be clear that what we are really talking about, in all
these cases, is not the ‘birth of the state’ in the sense of the emer gence, in
embryonic form, of a new and unprecedented institution that would grow
and evolve into modern forms of government. W e are speaking instead of
broad regional systems; it just happens, in the case of Egypt and the Andes,
that an entire regional system became united (at least some of the time)
under a single government. This was actually a fairly unusual arrangement.
More common were arrangements such as those in Shang China, where
uniﬁcation was lar gely theoretical; or Mesopotamia, where regional
hegemony rarely lasted for longer than a generation or two; or the Maya,
where there was a protracted struggle between two main power blocs,
neither of which could ever quite overcome the other .1 10
In terms of the speciﬁc theory we’ve been developing here, where the
three elementary forms of domination – control of violence, control of
knowledge, and charismatic power – can each crystallize into its own
institutional form (sovereignty , administration and heroic politics), almost
all these ‘early states’ could be more accurately described as ‘second-order ’
regimes of domination. First-order regimes like the Olmec, Chavín or
Natchez each developed only one part of the triad. But in the typically far
more violent arrangements of second-order regimes, two of the three
principles of domination were brought together in some spectacular ,
unprecedented way . Which two it was seems to have varied from case to
case. Egypt’ s early rulers combined sovereignty and administration;
Mesopotamian kings mixed administration and heroic politics; Classic
Maya ajaws  fused heroic politics with sovereignty .We should emphasize that it’ s not as if any of these principles, in their
elementary forms, were entirely absent in any one case: in fact, what seems
to have happened is that two of them crystallized into institutional forms –
fusing in such a way as to reinforce one another as the basis of government
– while the third form of domination was lar gely pushed out of the realm of
human af fairs altogether and displaced on to the non-human cosmos (as
with divine sovereignty in Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, or the cosmic
bureaucracy of the Classic Maya). Keeping all this in mind, let’ s return
brieﬂy to Egypt to clarify some remaining points.
IN WHICH WE RECONSIDER THE EGYPTIAN CASE IN LIGHT
OF OUR THREE ELEMENT ARY PRINCIPLES OF DOMINA TION,
AND ALSO REVISIT THE PROBLEM OF ‘DARK AGES’
The architects of Egypt’ s Old Kingdom clearly saw the world they were
creating as something like a cultured pearl, reared in precious isolation.
Their vision is vividly documented in relief carvings of stone, lining the
walls of royal temples, which served the mortuary cults of kings such as
Djoser , Menkaure, Sneferu and Sahure. Here Egypt, the ‘T wo Lands’, is
always represented as both a celestial theatre-state, in which king and gods
share equal billing, and an earthly domain: a world of rural estates and
hunting grounds, mapped out in a cartography of compliance, each parcel of
land personiﬁed as a lady-in-waiting who brings her bounty to the feet of
the king. The governing principle of this vision of Egypt is the monarch’ s
absolute sovereignty over everything, symbolized in his gigantic funerary
monuments, his deﬁant assertion that there was nothing he could not
conquer , even death.
Egyptian kingship was, however , Janus-faced. Its inner visage was that of
supreme patriarch, standing guard over a vastly extended family – a Great
House (the literal meaning of ‘pharaoh’). Its outer face is shown in
depictions of the king as a war leader or hunt leader asserting control over
the country’ s wild frontiers; all were fair game when the king turned his
violence upon them.1 1 1 This is very dif ferent, however , to heroic violence.
In a way , it’s the opposite. In a heroic order , the warrior ’s honour is based
on the fact that he might  lose; his reputation means so much to him that he
is willing to stake his life, dignity and freedom to defend it. Egyptian rulers,
in these early periods, never represent themselves as heroic ﬁgures in thissense. They could not, conceivably , lose. As a result, wars are not
represented as ‘political’ contests, which imply a match between potential
equals. Instead, combat and the chase alike were assertions of ownership,
endless rehearsals of the same sovereignty the king exercised over his
people and which ultimately derived from his kinship with the gods.
As we’ve already had occasion to observe, any form of sovereignty at
once so absolute and so personal as a pharaoh’ s will necessarily pose severe
problems of delegation. Here, too, all state ofﬁcials had to be in some sense
appendages of the king’ s own person. Major landowners, military
commanders, priests, administrators and other senior government ofﬁcials
also held titles like ‘Keeper of the King’ s Secrets’, ‘Beloved Acquaintance
of the King’, ‘Director of Music to the Pharaoh’, ‘Overseer of the Palace
Manicurists’ or even ‘of the King’ s Breakfast’. W e are not suggesting that
power games were absent here; no doubt there’ s never been a royal court
without jockeying for position, tricks and double-dealing and political
intrigue. The point is that these were not public contests, and no sanctioned
space existed for open competition. Everything remained conﬁned to life at
court. This is abundantly clear in the ‘tomb biographies’ of Old Kingdom
ofﬁcials, which describe their life achievements almost exclusively in terms
of their relationship to and their care for the king, rather than any personal
qualities or attainments.1 12
What we have in this case, then, seems to be a hypertrophy of the
principles of sovereignty and administration and an almost complete
absence of competitive politics. Dramatic public contests of any sort,
political or otherwise, were well-nigh non-existent. There is nothing in the
ofﬁcial sources of the Egyptian Old Kingdom (nor much in later periods of
ancient Egyptian history) that is remotely reminiscent of, say , Roman
chariot-racing or Olmec or Zapotec ball games. In the royal jubilee or sed
festival, when Egyptian kings ran a circuit to celebrate the uniﬁcation of the
Two Lands of Upper and Lower Egypt, it took the form of a solo
performance, the outcome of which was never in doubt. Insofar as
competitive politics appears in later Egyptian literature (which it
occasionally does), it takes place precisely between  the gods, as in works
like the Contendings of Horus and Seth . Dead kings, perhaps, compete with
one another; but by the time sovereignty comes down to the domain of
mortals, matters have already been settled.Just to be utterly clear about what we are saying here, when we speak of
an absence of charismatic politics we are talking about the absence of a
‘star system’ or ‘hall of fame’, with institutionalized rivalries between
knights, warlords, politicians and so on. W e are most certainly not speaking
about an absence of individual personalities. It’ s just that in a pure
monarchy there is only one person, or at best a handful of individuals, who
really matter . Indeed, if we are trying to understand the appeal of monarchy
as a form of government – and it cannot be denied that for much of
recorded human history it was a very popular one – then likely it has
something to do with its ability to mobilize sentiments of a caring nature
and abject terror at the same time. The king is both the ultimate individual,
his quirks and fancies always to be indulged like a spoilt baby , and at the
same time the ultimate abstraction, since his powers over mass violence,
and often (as in Egypt) mass production, can render everyone the same.
It is also worth observing that monarchy is probably the only prominent
system of government we know of in which children are crucial players,
since everything depends on the monarch’ s ability to continue the dynastic
line. The dead can be worshipped under any regime – even the United
States, which frames itself as a beacon of democracy , creates temples to its
Founding Fathers and carves portraits of dead presidents into the sides of
mountains – but infants, pure objects of love and nurture, are only
politically important in kingdoms and empires.
If the ancient Egyptian regime is often held out as the ﬁrst true state and a
paradigm for all future ones, it is lar gely because it was capable of
synthesizing absolute sovereignty – the monarch’ s ability to stand apart
from human society and engage in arbitrary violence with impunity – with
an administrative apparatus which, at certain moments at least, could reduce
almost everyone to cogs in a single great machine. Only heroic, competitive
politics was lacking, pushed of f into the worlds of gods and the dead. But
there was, of course, a great exception to this which comes precisely in
those periods when central authority broke down, the supposed ‘dark ages’,
beginning with the First Intermediate period ( c. 2181–2055 BC).
Already towards the end of the Old Kingdom, ‘nomarchs’ or local
governors had made themselves into de facto dynasties.1 13 When the
central government split between rival centres at Herakleopolis and Thebes,
such local leaders began to take over most functions of government. Oftenreferred to as ‘warlords’, these nomarchs were in fact nothing like the petty
kings of the Predynastic period. At least in their own monuments, they
represent themselves as something closer to popular heroes, even saints.
Neither was this always just idle boasting; some were indeed revered as
saints for centuries to come. No doubt charismatic local leaders had always
existed in Egypt; but with the breakdown of the patrimonial state, such
ﬁgures could begin to make open claims of authority based on their
personal achievements and attributes (bravery , generosity , oratorical and
strategic skills) and – crucially – redeﬁne social authority itself as based on
qualities of public service and piety to the gods of their local town, and the
popular support those qualities inspired.
In other words, whenever state sovereignty broke down, heroic politics
returned – with charismatic ﬁgures just as vainglorious and competitive,
perhaps, as those we know from ancient epics, but far less bloodthirsty . The
change is clearly visible in autobiographical inscriptions, like those in the
rock-cut tomb of the nomarch Ankhtiﬁ at El-Mo’alla, south of Thebes.
Here’ s how he narrates his role in war: ‘I was one who found the solution
when it was lacking, thanks to my vigorous plans; one with commanding
words and untroubled mind on the day when the nomes [administered
territories] allied together (to wage war). I am the hero without equal; one
who spoke freely while people were silent on the day when fear was spread
and Upper Egypt did not dare to speak.’ Even more striking, here’ s how he
celebrates his social achievements:
I gave bread to the hungry and clothing to the naked; I anointed
those who had no cosmetic oil; I gave sandals to the barefooted; I
gave a wife to him who had no wife. I took care of the towns of
Hefat [El-Mo’alla] and Hor -mer in every [crisis, when] the sky was
clouded and the earth [was parched? And people died] of hunger on
this sandbank of Apophis. The south came with its people and the
north with its children; they brought ﬁnest oil in exchange for barley
which was given to them … All of Upper Egypt was dying of
hunger and people were eating their children, but I did not allow
anybody to die of hunger in this nome … never did I allow anybody
in need to go from this nome to another one. I am the hero without
equal.1 14It’s only at this point, in the First Intermediate period, that we see a
hereditary aristocracy coming into its own in Egypt, as local magnates like
Ankhtiﬁ began transferring their powers to their of fspring and extended
families. Aristocracy and personal politics had no such recognized place in
the Old Kingdom, precisely because they came into conﬂict with the
principle of sovereignty . In summary , the transition from Old Kingdom to
First Intermediate period was not so much a shift from ‘order ’ to ‘chaos’ –
as Egyptological orthodoxy once had it – as a swing from ‘sovereignty’ to
‘charismatic politics’ as dif ferent ways of framing the exercise of power .
With that came a shift in emphasis, from the people’ s care of god-like rulers
to the care of the people as a legitimate path to authority . In ancient Egypt,
as so often in history , signiﬁcant political accomplishments occur in
precisely those periods (the so-called ‘dark ages’) that get dismissed or
overlooked because no one was building grandiose monuments in stone.
IN WHICH WE GO IN SEARCH OF THE REAL ORIGINS OF
BUREAUCRACY , AND FIND THEM ON WHA T APPEARS T O BE
A SURPRISINGL Y SMALL SCALE
At this point it should be easy enough to understand why ancient Egypt is
so regularly held out as the paradigmatic example of state formation. It’ s
not just that it is chronologically the earliest of what we’ve called second-
order regimes of domination; aside from the much later Inca Empire, it’ s
also just about the only case where the two principles that came together
were sovereignty and administration. In other words, it’ s the only case from
a suitably distant phase of history that perfectly ﬁts the model of what
should  have happened. All such assumptions really go back to a certain
kind of social theory – or , maybe better put, a theory of or ganization – that
we described at the start of Chapter Eight . Small, intimate groups (the
argument goes) might be able to adopt informal, egalitarian means of
problem-solving, but as soon as lar ge numbers of people are assembled
together in a city or a kingdom everything changes.
It’s simply assumed, in this kind of theory , that once societies scale up
they will need, as Robin Dunbar puts it, ‘chiefs to direct, and a police force
to ensure that social rules are adhered to’; or as Jared Diamond says, ‘lar ge
populations can’ t function without leaders who make the decisions,
executives who carry out the decisions, and bureaucrats who administer thedecisions and laws.’1 15 In other words, if you want to live in a lar ge-scale
society you need a sovereign and an administration. It is more or less taken
for granted that some kind of monopoly of coercive force (again, the ability
to threaten everyone with weapons) is ultimately required in order to do
this. W riting systems, in turn, are almost invariably assumed to have
developed in the service of impersonal bureaucratic states, which were the
result of the whole process.
Now , as we’ve already seen, none of this is really true, and predictions
based on these assumptions almost invariably turn out to be wrong. W e saw
one dramatic example in Chapter Eight . It was once widely assumed that if
bureaucratic states tend to arise in areas with complex irrigation systems, it
must have been because of the need for administrators to co-ordinate the
maintenance of canals and regulate the water supply . In fact, it turns out that
farmers are perfectly capable of co-ordinating very complicated irrigation
systems all by themselves, and there’ s little evidence, in most cases, that
early bureaucrats had anything to do with such matters. Urban populations
seem to have a remarkable capacity for self-governance in ways which,
while usually not quite ‘egalitarian’, were likely a good deal more
participatory than almost any urban government today . Meanwhile most
ancient emperors, as it turns out, saw little reason to interfere, as they
simply didn’ t care very much about how their subjects cleaned the streets or
maintained their drainage ditches.
We’ve also observed that when early regimes do base their domination
on exclusive access to forms of knowledge, these are often not the kinds of
knowledge we ourselves would consider particularly practical (the
shamanic, psychotropic revelations that seem to have inspired the builders
of Chavín de Huántar would be one such example). In fact, the ﬁrst forms
of functional administration, in the sense of keeping archives of lists,
ledgers, accounting procedures, overseers, audits and ﬁles, seem to emer ge
in precisely these kinds of ritual contexts: in Mesopotamian temples,
Egyptian ancestor cults, Chinese oracle readings and so forth.1 16 So one
thing we can now say with a fair degree of certainty is that bureaucracy did
not begin simply as a practical solution to problems of information
management, when human societies advanced beyond a particular threshold
of scale and complexity .
This, however , raises the interesting question of where and when such
technologies did ﬁrst arise, and for what reason. Here there’ s somesurprising new evidence too. Our emer ging archaeological understanding
suggests that the ﬁrst systems of specialized administrative control actually
emer ged in very small communities. The earliest clear evidence of this
appears in a series of tiny prehistoric settlements in the Middle East, dating
over 1,000 years after the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük was founded (at
around 7400 BC), but still more than 2,000 years before the appearance of
anything even vaguely resembling a city .
The best example of such a site is T ell Sabi Abyad, investigated by a team
of Dutch archaeologists working in Syria’ s Balikh valley in the province of
Raqqa. Around 8,000 years ago ( c.6200 BC), in what was prehistoric
Mesopotamia, a one-hectare village was destroyed there by ﬁre, baking its
mud walls and many of their clay contents, thus preserving them. While
obviously a very bad bit of luck for the inhabitants, it was a stroke of
brilliant luck for future researchers, since it has left us a unique insight into
the or ganization of a Late Neolithic community , comprising perhaps around
150 individuals.1 17 What the excavators discovered is that not only did the
inhabitants of this village erect central storage facilities, including granaries
and warehouses; they also employed administrative devices of some
complexity to keep track of what was in them. These devices included
economic archives, which were miniature precursors to the temple archives
at Uruk and other later Mesopotamian cities.
These were not written archives: writing, as such, would not appear for
another 3,000 years. What did exist were geometric tokens made of clay , of
a sort that appear to have been used in many similar Neolithic villages,
most likely to keep track of the allocation of particular resources.1 18 At T ell
Sabi Abyad, miniature seals bearing engraved designs were used alongside
them to stamp and mark the clay stoppers of household vessels with
identifying signs.1 19 Perhaps most remarkably , the stoppers themselves,
once removed from the vessels, were kept and archived in a special building
– an ofﬁce or bureau of sorts – near the centre of the village for later
reference.120 Ever since these discoveries were reported in the 1990s,
archaeologists have been debating in whose interests and for what purpose
such ‘village bureaucracies’ functioned.
In trying to answer this question, it’ s important to note that the central
bureau and depot of T ell Sabi Abyad is not associated with any kind of
unusually lar ge residence, rich burials or other signs of personal status. Ifanything, what’ s striking about the remains of this community is their
uniformity: the surrounding dwellings, for instance, are all roughly equal in
size, quality and surviving contents. The contents themselves suggest small
family units which maintained a complex division of labour , often including
tasks that would have required the co-operation of multiple households.
Flocks had to be pastured, a variety of cereal crops sown, harvested and
threshed, as well as ﬂax for weaving, which was practised alongside other
household crafts such as potting, bead-making, stone-carving and simple
forms of metalworking. And of course there were children to raise, old
people to care for , houses to build and maintain, marriages and funerals to
co-ordinate, and so on.
Careful scheduling and mutual aid would have been vital for the
successful completion of an annual round of productive activities, while
evidence of obsidian, metals and exotic pigments indicates that villagers
also interacted regularly with outsiders, no doubt through intermarriage as
well as travel and trade.121 As we’ve already observed in the case of
traditional Basque villages, these sorts of activity could well involve quite
complicated mathematical calculations. Still, this in itself doesn’ t explain
why there was a need to fall back on precise systems of measurement and
archiving. After all, there are untold thousands of agricultural communities
across human history who juggled similarly complex combinations of tasks
and responsibilities without having to create new techniques of record-
keeping.
Whatever the reason, the ef fect of introducing such techniques seems to
have been profound for villages in prehistoric Mesopotamia and the
surrounding hill country . Recall that 2,000 years separate T ell Sabi Abyad
from the earliest cities, and during that long span of time village life in the
Middle East underwent a series of remarkable changes. In some ways,
people living in small-scale communities began to act as if they were
already living in mass societies of a certain kind, even though nobody had
ever seen a city . It sounds counter -intuitive – but it is what we see in the
intervening centuries in the evidence of villages scattered across a lar ge
region, from southwestern Iran through much of Iraq and all the way over
to the T urkish highlands. In many ways this phenomenon was another
version of the kind of ‘culture areas’ or hospitality zones that we discussed
in earlier chapters, but there was a dif ferent element: afﬁnities between
distant households and families seem to have been increasingly based on aprinciple of cultural uniformity . In a sense, then, this was the ﬁrst era of the
‘global village’.122
What it all looks like, in the archaeological record, is impossible to miss.
We write from ﬁrst-hand experience here, since one of us has conducted
archaeological investigations of prehistoric villages in Iraqi Kurdistan,
dating before and after the great transformation took place. What you ﬁnd,
in the ﬁfth millennium BC, is the gradual disappearance from village life of
most outward signs of dif ference or individuality , as administrative tools
and other new media technologies spread across a lar ge swathe of the
Middle East. Households were now built to increasingly standard tripartite
plans, and pottery , which had once been a way of expressing individual skill
and creativity , now seems to have been made deliberately drab, uniform and
in some cases almost standardized. Craft production in general became
more mechanical, and female labour was subject to new forms of spatial
control and segregation.123
In fact this entire period, lasting around 1,000 years (archaeologists call it
the ‘Ubaid, after the site of T ell al-‘Ubaid in southern Iraq), was one of
innovation in metallur gy, horticulture, textiles, diet and long-distance trade;
but from a social vantage point, everything seems to have been done to
prevent such innovations becoming markers of rank or individual
distinction – in other words, to prevent the emer gence of obvious
differences in status, both within and between villages. Intriguingly , it is
possible that we are witnessing the birth of an overt ideology of equality in
the centuries prior to the emer gence of the world’ s ﬁrst cities, and that
administrative tools were ﬁrst designed not as a means of extracting and
accumulating wealth but precisely to prevent such things from
happening.124 To get a sense of how such small-scale bureaucracies might
have worked in practice we can brieﬂy consider again the ayllu , those
Andean village associations which, as we mentioned earlier , had their own
home-grown administration.
Ayllu too were based on a strong principle of equality; their members
literally wore uniforms, with each valley having its own traditional design
of cloth. One of the ayllu ’s main functions was to redistribute agricultural
land as families grew lar ger or smaller , to ensure none grew richer than any
other – indeed, to be a ‘rich’ household meant, in practice, to have a lar ge
number of unmarried children, hence much land, since there was no other
basis for comparing wealth.125 Ayllu also helped families avoid seasonallabour crunches and kept track of the number of able-bodied young men
and women in each household, so as to ensure not only that none were
short-handed at critical moments, but also that the aged or inﬁrm, widows,
orphans or disabled were taken care of.
Between households, responsibilities came down to a principle of
reciprocity: records were kept and at the end of each year all outstanding
credits and debts were to be cancelled out. This is where the ‘village
bureaucracy’ comes in. T o do that meant units of work had to be measured
in a way which allowed clear resolution to the inevitable ar guments that
crop up in such situations – about who did what for whom, and who owed
what to whom.126 Each ayllu  appears to have had its own khipu  strings,
which were constantly knotted and re-knotted to keep track as debts were
registered or cancelled out. It’ s possible that khipu  were invented for such
purposes. In other words, although the actual administrative tools used were
different, the reason for their existence was quite similar to what we
envisage for the village accounting systems in prehistoric Mesopotamia,
and rooted in a similarly explicit ideal of equality .127
Of course, the danger of such accounting procedures is that they can be
turned to other purposes: the precise system of equivalence that underlies
them has the potential to give almost any social arrangement, even those
founded on arbitrary violence (e.g. ‘conquest’), an air of even-handedness
and equity . That is why sovereignty and administration make such a
potentially lethal combination, taking the equalizing ef fects of the latter and
transforming them into tools of social domination, even tyranny .
Under the Inca, let’ s recall, all ayllus  were reduced to the status of
‘conquered women’ and khipu  strings were employed to keep track of
labour debts owed to the central Inca administration. Unlike the local string
records, these were ﬁxed and non-negotiable; the knots were never
unravelled and retied. Here it is necessary to overcome a few myths about
the Inca, who are often portrayed as the mildest of empires – even a kind of
benevolent proto-socialist state. In fact, it was the pre-existing ayllu  system
that continued to provide social security under Inca rule. By contrast, the
overarching administrative structure put in place by the Inca court was
largely extractive and exploitative in nature (even if local ofﬁcers of the
court preferred to misrepresent it as an extension of ayllu  principles): for
purposes of central monitoring and recording, households were grouped
into units of 10, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000 and so on, each responsible forlabour obligations over and above those they already owed to their
community , in a way that could only play havoc with existing allegiances,
geography and communal or ganization.128 Corvée duties were assigned
uniformly according to a rigid scale of measurement; work tasks might
simply be invented if there was nothing that needed doing; scofﬂaws faced
severe punishment.129
The results were predictable, and we can see them clearly reﬂected in the
ﬁrst-hand accounts supplied by Spanish chroniclers of the time, who took
an obvious interest in Inca strategies of conquest and domination and their
local workings. Community leaders became de facto state agents, and either
took advantage of legalisms to get rich or tried to shield their wards and
themselves if they got in to trouble. Those who were unable to meet labour
debts or who tried unsuccessfully to ﬂee or rebel, were reduced to the status
of servants, retainers and concubines for Inca courts and ofﬁcials.130 This
new class of hereditary peons was growing rapidly at the time of Spanish
conquest.
None of which is to say the Inca reputation as adept administrators is
unfounded. They apparently were capable of keeping exact track of births
and deaths, adjusting household numbers at yearly festivals and so on. Why ,
then, impose such an oddly clumsy and monolithic system on to an existing
one (the ayllu ) which was clearly more nuanced? It’ s hard to escape the
impression that in all such situations, the apparent heavy-handedness, the
insistence on following the rules even when they make no sense, is really
half the point. Perhaps this is simply how sovereignty manifests itself, in
bureaucratic form. By ignoring the unique history of every household, each
individual, by reducing everything to numbers one provides a language of
equity – but simultaneously ensures that there will always be some who fail
to meet their quotas, and therefore that there will always be a supply of
peons, pawns or slaves.
In the Middle East, very similar things appear to have happened in later
periods of history . Most famously , perhaps, the books of the Prophets in the
Hebrew Bible preserve memories of powerful protests that ensued as
demands for tribute drove farmers into penury , forced them to pawn their
ﬂocks and vineyards, and ultimately surrender their children into debt
peonage. Or wealthy merchants and administrators took advantage of crop
failures, ﬂoods, natural disasters or neighbours’ simple bad luck to of fer
interest-bearing loans that led to the same results. Similar complaints arerecorded in China and India as well. The ﬁrst establishment of bureaucratic
empires is almost always accompanied by some kind of system of
equivalence run amok. This is not the place to outline a history of money
and debt131 – only to note that it’ s no coincidence that societies like those
of Uruk-period Mesopotamia were, simultaneously , commercial and
bureaucratic. Both money and administration are based on similar
principles of impersonal  equivalence. What we wish to emphasize at this
point is how frequently the most violent inequalities seem to arise, in the
ﬁrst instance, from such ﬁctions of legal equality . All citizens of a city , or
all worshippers of its god, or all subjects of its king were considered
ultimately the same – at least in that one speciﬁc way . The same laws, the
same rights, the same responsibilities applied to all of them, whether as
individuals or , in later and more patriarchal times, as families under the
aegis of some paterfamilias .
What’ s important here is the fact that this equality could be viewed as
making people (as well as things) interchangeable, which in turn allowed
rulers, or their henchmen, to make impersonal demands that took no
consideration of their subjects’ unique situations. This is of course what
gives the word ‘bureaucracy’ such distasteful associations almost
everywhere today . The very term evokes mechanical stupidity . But there’ s
no reason to believe that impersonal systems were originally , or are
necessarily , stupid. If the calculations of a Bolivian ayllu  or Basque council
– or presumably a Neolithic village administration like that of T ell Sabi
Abyad, and its urban successors in Mesopotamia – produced an obviously
impossible or unreasonable result, matters could always be adjusted. As
anyone knows who has spent time in a rural community , or serving on a
municipal or parish council of a lar ge city , resolving such inequities might
require many hours, possibly days of tedious discussion, but almost always
a solution will be arrived at that no one ﬁnds entirely unfair . It’s the addition
of sovereign power , and the resulting ability of the local enforcer to say ,
‘Rules are rules; I don’ t want to hear about it’ that allows bureaucratic
mechanisms to become genuinely monstrous.
Over the course of this book we have had occasion to refer to the three
primordial freedoms, those which for most of human history were simply
assumed: the freedom to move, the freedom to disobey and the freedom to
create or transform social relationships. W e also noted how the Englishword ‘free’ ultimately derives from a Germanic term meaning ‘friend’ –
since, unlike free people, slaves cannot have friends because they cannot
make commitments or promises. The freedom to make promises is about
the most basic and minimal element of our third freedom, much as
physically running away from a difﬁcult situation is the most basic element
of the ﬁrst. In fact, the earliest word for ‘freedom’ recorded in any human
language is the Sumerian term ama(r)-gi , which literally means ‘return to
mother ’ – because Sumerian kings would periodically issue decrees of debt
freedom, cancelling all non-commercial debts and in some cases allowing
those held as debt peons in their creditors’ households to return home to
their kin.132
One might ask, how could that most basic element of all human
freedoms, the freedom to make promises and commitments and thus build
relationships, be turned into its very opposite: into peonage, serfdom or
permanent slavery? It happens, we’d suggest, precisely when promises
become impersonal, transferable – in a nutshell, bureaucratized. It is one of
history’ s great ironies that Madame de Grafﬁgny’ s notion of the Inca state
as a model of a benevolent, bureaucratic order actually derives from a
misreading of the sources, if a very common one: mistaking the social
beneﬁts of local, self-or ganized administrative units ( ayllu ) for an imperial,
Inca structure of command, which in reality served almost exclusively to
provision the army , priesthood and administrative classes.133
Mesopotamian and later Chinese kings also tended to represent themselves,
like the Egyptian nomarchs, as protectors of the weak, feeders of the
hungry , solace of widows and orphans.
As money is to promises, we might say , state bureaucracy is to the
principle of care: in each case we ﬁnd one of the most fundamental building
blocks of social life corrupted by a conﬂuence of maths and violence.
IN WHICH, ARMED WITH NEW KNOWLEDGE, WE RETHINK
SOME BASIC PREMISES OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION
Social scientists and political philosophers have been debating the ‘origins
of the state’ for well over a century . These debates are never resolved and
are unlikely ever to be. At this point, at least we can understand why . Much
like the search for the ‘origins of inequality’, seeking the origins of the state
is little more than chasing a phantasm. As we noted at the beginning of thechapter , it never occurred to Spanish conquistadors to ask whether or not
they were dealing with ‘states’ since the concept didn’ t really exist at the
time. The language they used, of kingdoms, empires and republics, serves
just as well, and in many ways rather better .
Historians, of course, still speak of kingdoms, empires and republics. If
social scientists have come to prefer the language of ‘states’ and ‘state
formation’ it’ s largely because this is taken to be more scientiﬁc – despite
the lack of consistent deﬁnition. It’ s not clear why . Part of the reason might
be that the notions of ‘the state’ and of modern science both emer ged
around the same time and were to a certain degree entangled with one
another . Whatever the cause, because the existing literature is so
relentlessly focused on a single narrative of increasing complexity ,
hierarchy and state formation, it becomes very difﬁcult to use the term
‘state’ for any other purpose.
The fact that our planet is, at the present time, almost entirely covered by
states obviously makes it easy to write as if such an outcome was
inevitable. Y et our present situation regularly leads people to make
‘scientiﬁc’ assumptions about how we got here that have almost nothing to
do with the actual data. Certain salient features of current arrangements are
just projected backwards, presumed to exist once society has attained a
certain degree of complexity – unless deﬁnitive evidence of their absence
can be produced.
For example, it is often simply assumed that states begin when certain
key functions of government – military , administrative and judicial – pass
into the hands of full-time specialists. This makes sense if you accept the
narrative that an agricultural surplus ‘freed up’ a signiﬁcant portion of the
population from the onerous responsibility of securing adequate amounts of
food: a story that suggests the beginning of a process that would lead to our
current global division of labour . Early states might have used this surplus
largely to support full-time bureaucrats, priests, soldiers and the like, but –
we are always reminded – its existence also allowed for full-time sculptors,
poets and astronomers.
It’s a compelling story . It is also quite true when applied to our present-
day situation (at least, only a small percentage of us are now involved in the
production and distribution of foodstuf fs). However , almost none of the
regimes we’ve been considering in this chapter were actually staf fed by
full-time specialists. Most obviously , none seem to have had a standingarmy . Warfare was lar gely a business for the agricultural of f-season. Priests
and judges rarely worked full-time either; in fact, most government
institutions in Old Kingdom Egypt, Shang China, Early Dynastic
Mesopotamia or for that matter classical Athens were staf fed by a rotating
workforce whose members had other lives as managers of rural estates,
traders, builders or any number of dif ferent occupations.134
One could go further . It’s not clear to what degree many of these ‘early
states’ were themselves lar gely seasonal phenomena (recall that, at least as
far back as the Ice Age, seasonal gatherings could be stages for the
performance  of something that looks to us a bit like kingship; rulers held
court only during certain periods of the year; and some clans or warrior
societies were given state-like police powers only during the winter
months).135 Like warfare, the business of government tended to
concentrate strongly upon certain times of year: there were months full of
building projects, pageants, festivals, census-taking, oaths of allegiance,
trials and spectacular executions; and other times when a king’ s subjects
(and sometimes even the king himself) scattered to attend to the more
urgent needs of planting, harvesting and pasturage. This doesn’ t mean these
kingdoms weren’ t real: they were capable of mobilizing, or for that matter
killing and maiming, thousands of human beings. It just means that their
reality was, in ef fect, sporadic. They appeared and then dissolved away .
Could it be that, in the same way that play farming – our term for those
loose and ﬂexible methods of cultivation which leave people free to pursue
any number of other seasonal activities – turned into more serious
agriculture, play kingdoms began to take on more substance as well? The
evidence from Egypt might be interpreted along these lines. But it’ s also
possible that both these processes, when they did happen, were ultimately
driven by something else, such as the emer gence of patriarchal relations and
the decline of women’ s power within the household. Surely these are the
kinds of questions we should  be asking. Ethnography also teaches us that
kings are rarely content with the idea of being a sporadic presence in most
of their subjects’ lives. Even rulers of kingdoms that nobody would
describe as a state, like the Shilluk reth or rulers of minor principalities in
Java or Madagascar , would try to insert themselves into the rhythms of
ordinary social life by insisting that no one can swear an oath, or marry , or
even greet one another without invoking their name. In this manner , the
king would become the necessary means by which his subjects establishedrelations with each other , in much the same way as later heads of state
would insist on putting their faces on money .
In 1852 the W esleyan minister and missionary Richard B. L yth described
how in the Fijian kingdom of Cakaudrove there was a daily rule of absolute
silence at sunrise. Then the king’ s herald would proclaim that he was about
to chew his kava root, whereon all his subjects shouted, ‘Chew it!’ This was
followed by a thunderous roar when the ritual was completed. The ruler was
the Sun, who gave both life and order to his people. He recreated the
universe each day . In fact, most scholars nowadays insist this king wasn’ t
even a king, but merely the head of a ‘confederacy of chiefdoms’ who ruled
over perhaps a few thousand people. Such cosmic claims are regularly
made in royal ritual almost everywhere in the world, and their grandeur
seems to bear almost no relation to a ruler ’s actual power (as in their ability
to make anyone do anything they don’ t want to do). If ‘the state’ means
anything, it refers to precisely the totalitarian impulse that lies behind all
such claims, the desire ef fectively to make the ritual last forever .136
Monuments like the Egyptian pyramids seem to have served a similar
purpose. They were attempts to make a certain kind of power seem eternal
– the kind that only really manifested itself in those particular months when
pyramid construction was under way . Inscriptions or objects designed to
project an image of cosmic power – palaces, mausoleums, lavish stelae with
godlike ﬁgures announcing laws or boasting of their conquests – are
precisely the ones most likely to endure, thereby forming the core of the
world’ s major heritage sites and museum collections today . Such is their
power that even now we risk falling under their spell. W e don’ t really know
how seriously to take them. After all, the Fijian subjects of the King of
Cakaudrove must at least have been willing to play along with the daily
sunrise ritual, since he lacked much in the way of means to compel them.
Yet rulers such as Sar gon the Great of Akkad or the First Emperor of China
had many such means at their disposal, and as a result we can say even less
about what their subjects really made of their more grandiose claims.137
To understand the realities of power , whether in modern or ancient
societies, is to acknowledge this gap between what elites claim they can do
and what they are actually able to do. As the sociologist Philip Abrams
pointed out long ago, failure to make this distinction has led social scientists
up countless blind alleys, because the state is ‘not the reality which stands
behind the mask of political practice. It is itself the mask which preventsour seeing political practice as it is.’ T o understand the latter , he ar gued, we
must attend to ‘the senses in which the state does not exist rather than to
those in which it does’.138 We can now see that these points apply just as
forcefully to ancient political regimes as they do to modern ones – if not
more so.
An origin for ‘the state’ has long been sought in such diverse places as
ancient Egypt, Inca Peru and Shang China, but what we now regard as
states turn out not to be a constant of history at all; not the result of a long
evolutionary process that began in the Bronze Age, but rather a conﬂuence
of three political forms – sovereignty , administration and charismatic
competition – that have dif ferent origins. Modern states are simply one way
in which the three principles of domination happened to come together , but
this time with a notion that the power of kings is held by an entity called
‘the people’ (or ‘the nation’), that bureaucracies exist for the beneﬁt of said
‘people’, and in which a variation on old, aristocratic contests and prizes
has come to be relabelled as ‘democracy’, most often in the form of
national elections. There was nothing inevitable about it. If proof of that
were required, we need only observe how much this particular arrangement
is currently coming apart. As we noted, there are now planetary
bureaucracies (public and private, ranging from the IMF and WT O to J. P .
Morgan Chase and various credit-rating agencies) without anything that
resembles a corresponding principle of global sovereignty or global ﬁeld of
competitive politics; and everything from cryptocurrencies to private
security agencies, undermining the sovereignty of states.
If anything is clear by now it’ s this. Where we once assumed
‘civilization’ and ‘state’ to be conjoined entities that came down to us as a
historical package (take it or leave it, forever), what history now
demonstrates is that these terms actually refer to complex amalgams of
elements which have entirely dif ferent origins and which are currently in
the process of drifting apart. Seen this way , to rethink the basic premises of
social evolution is to rethink the very idea of politics itself.
CODA: ON CIVILIZA TION, EMPTY W ALLS AND HIST ORIES
STILL T O BE WRITTEN
On reﬂection, it’ s odd that the term ‘civilization’ – one we’ve not discussed
much until now – ever came to be used this way in the ﬁrst place. Whenpeople talk about ‘early civilizations’ they are mostly referring to those very
same societies we’ve been describing in this chapter and their direct
successors: Pharaonic Egypt, Inca Peru, Aztec Mexico, Han China, Imperial
Rome, ancient Greece, or others of a certain scale and monumentality . All
these were deeply stratiﬁed societies, held together mostly by authoritarian
government, violence and the radical subordination of women. Sacriﬁce, as
we’ve seen, is the shadow lurking behind this concept of civilization: the
sacriﬁce of our three basic freedoms, and of life itself, for the sake of
something always out of reach – whether that be an ideal of world order , the
Mandate of Heaven or blessings from insatiable gods. Is it any wonder that
in some circles the very idea of ‘civilization’ has fallen into disrepute?
Something very basic has gone wrong here.
One problem is that we’ve come to assume that ‘civilization’ refers, in
origin, simply to the habit of living in cities. Cities, in turn, were thought to
imply states. But as we’ve seen, that is not the case historically , or even
etymologically .139 The word ‘civilization’ derives from Latin civilis , which
actually refers to those qualities of political wisdom and mutual aid that
permit societies to or ganize themselves through voluntary coalition. In other
words, it originally meant the type of qualities exhibited by Andean ayllu
associations or Basque villages, rather than Inca courtiers or Shang dynasts.
If mutual aid, social co-operation, civic activism, hospitality or simply
caring for others are the kind of things that really go to make civilizations,
then this true history of civilization is only just starting to be written.
As we saw in Chapter Five , Marcel Mauss took some initial, furtive steps
in that direction but was lar gely ignored; and, as he anticipated, such a
history might well begin with those geographically expansive ‘culture
areas’ or ‘interaction spheres’ that archaeologists can now trace back into
periods far earlier than kingdoms or empires, or even cities. As we’ve seen,
physical evidence left behind by common forms of domestic life, ritual and
hospitality shows us this deep history of civilization. In some ways it’ s
much more inspiring than monuments. Ar guably , the most important
ﬁndings of modern archaeology are precisely these vibrant and far -ﬂung
networks of kinship and commerce, where those who rely lar gely on
speculation have expected to ﬁnd only backward and isolated ‘tribes’.
As we’ve been showing throughout this book, in all parts of the world
small communities formed civilizations in that true sense of extended moral
communities. W ithout permanent kings, bureaucrats or standing armies theyfostered the growth of mathematical and calendrical knowledge. In some
regions they pioneered metallur gy, the cultivation of olives, vines and date
palms, or the invention of leavened bread and wheat beer; in others they
domesticated maize and learned to extract poisons, medicines and mind-
altering substances from plants. Civilizations, in this true sense, developed
the major textile technologies applied to fabrics and basketry , the potter ’s
wheel, stone industries and beadwork, the sail and maritime navigation, and
so on.
A moment’ s reﬂection shows that women, their work, their concerns and
innovations are at the core of this more accurate understanding of
civilization. As we saw in earlier chapters, tracing the place of women in
societies without writing often means using clues left, quite literally , in the
fabric of material culture, such as painted ceramics that mimic both textile
designs and female bodies in their forms and elaborate decorative
structures. T o take just two examples, it’ s hard to believe that the kind of
complex mathematical knowledge displayed in early Mesopotamian
cuneiform documents or in the layout of Peru’ s Chavín temples sprang fully
formed from the mind of a male scribe or sculptor , like Athena from the
head of Zeus. Far more likely , these represent knowledge accumulated in
earlier times through concrete practices such as the solid geometry and
applied calculus of weaving or beadwork.140 What until now has passed for
‘civilization’ might in fact be nothing more than a gendered appropriation –
by men, etching their claims in stone – of some earlier system of knowledge
that had women at its centre.
We began this chapter by noting how often the expansion of ambitious
polities, and the concentration of power in a few hands, was accompanied
by the mar ginalization of women, if not their violent subordination. This
seems to be true not just of second-order regimes like Aztec Mexico and
Old Kingdom Egypt but also of ﬁrst-order ones like Chavín de Huántar . But
what about cases where, even as societies scaled up and also took on more
centralized forms of government, women and their concerns remained at the
core of things? Do any such exist in history? This brings us to our ﬁnal
example: Minoan Crete.
Whatever was happening during the Bronze Age on Crete, the lar gest and
most southerly of the Aegean islands, it clearly doesn’ t quite ﬁt the
scholarly playbook of ‘state formation’. Y et the remains of what has cometo be called Minoan society are too dramatic, too impressive and too close
to the heart of Europe (and what was to become the classical world) to be
sidelined or ignored. Indeed, in the 1970s the renowned archaeologist Colin
Renfrew chose nothing less than The Emer gence of Civilisation  as the title
of his important book on the prehistory of the Aegean, to the eternal
confusion and annoyance of archaeologists working anywhere else.141
Despite this high proﬁle, and more than a century of intense ﬁeldwork,
Minoan Crete remains a kind of beautiful irritant for archaeological theory ,
and frankly a source of puzzlement to anyone coming at the topic from
outside.
Much of our knowledge comes from the metropolis of Knossos, as well
as other major centres at Phaestos, Malia and Zakros, which are usually
described as ‘palatial societies’ that existed between 1700 and 1450 BC (the
Neopalatial or ‘New Palace’ period).142 Certainly , they were very
impressive places at this time. Knossos, thought to have had a population of
about 25,000,143 in many ways resembles similar cities in other parts of the
eastern Mediterranean, centring as it does on lar ge palace complexes replete
with industrial quarters and storage facilities, and a system of writing on
clay tablets (‘Linear A ’) which, frustratingly , has never been deciphered.
The problem is that, unlike palatial societies of roughly the same age – such
as those of Zimri-Lim at Mari on the Syrian Euphrates, or in Hittite
Anatolia to the north, or Egypt – there is simply no clear evidence of
monarchy on Minoan Crete.144
It’s not for lack of material. W e might not be able to read the writing, but
Crete and the nearby island of Thera (Santorini) – where a bed of volcanic
ash preserves the Minoan town of Akrotiri in splendid detail – actually
furnish us with one of the most extensive bodies of pictorial art from the
Bronze Age world: not just frescoes, but also ivories and detailed
engravings on seals and jewellery .145 By far the most frequent depictions
of authority ﬁgures in Minoan art show adult women in boldly patterned
skirts that extend over their shoulders but are open at the chest.146 Women
are regularly depicted at a lar ger scale than men, a sign of political
superiority in the visual traditions of all neighbouring lands. They hold
symbols of command, like the staf f-wielding ‘Mother of Mountains’ who
appears on seal impressions from a major shrine at Knossos; they perform
fertility rites before horned altars, sit on thrones, meet together in
assemblies with no male presiding and appear ﬂanked by supernaturalcreatures and dangerous animals.147 Most male depictions, on the other
hand, are either of scantily clad or naked athletes (no women are depicted
naked in Minoan art); or show men bringing tribute and adopting poses of
subservience before female dignitaries. All this is without parallel in the
highly patriarchal societies of Syria, Lebanon, Anatolia and Egypt (all
regions that Cretans of the time were familiar with, since they visited them
as traders and diplomats).
Scholarly interpretations of Minoan palatial art, with its array of powerful
females, are somewhat perplexing. Most follow Arthur Evans, the early-
twentieth-century excavator of Knossos, in identifying such ﬁgures as
goddesses, or priestesses wielding no earthly power – almost as though they
have no connection to the real world.148 They tend to come up in the
‘religion and ritual’ sections of books on Aegean art and archaeology as
opposed to ‘politics’, ‘economics’ or ‘social structure’ – politics, in
particular , being reconstructed with almost no reference to the art at all.
Others simply avoid the issue altogether , describing Minoan political life as
clearly dif ferent, but ultimately impenetrable (a gendered sentiment if ever
there was one). W ould this keep happening if these were images of men in
positions of authority? Unlikely , since the same scholars usually have no
trouble identifying similar scenes that involve males – painted on the walls
of Egyptian tombs, for example – or even actual representations of Keftiu
(Cretans) bringing tribute to powerful Egyptian men as reﬂections of real
power relations.
Another puzzling bit of evidence is the nature of the wares that Minoan
merchants imported from abroad. Minoans were a trading people, and the
traders appear to have been mostly men. But starting in the Proto-palatial
period, what they brought home from overseas had a distinctively female
ﬂavour . Egyptian sistra, cosmetic jars, ﬁgures of nursing mothers and scarab
amulets do not come from the male-dominated sphere of courtly culture but
the rituals of non-royal Egyptian women and the gynocentric rites of
Hathor . Hathor was celebrated outside Egypt too, in temples near the Sinai
turquoise mines and in maritime ports, where the horned goddess morphed
into a protector of travellers. One such port was Byblos on the Lebanese
coast, where an assemblage of cosmetics and amulets – almost identical to
those from early Cretan tombs – was found buried as of ferings in a temple.
Most likely , such objects travelled along with women’ s cults, perhaps like
the much later cults of Isis, tracking the ‘ofﬁcial’ trade of male elites. Theconcentration of these items within prestigious Cretan tholos  tombs in the
period just before the formation of palaces (another of those neglected
‘proto-periods’) suggests, at the very least, that women occupied the
demand side of such long-distance exchanges.149
Again, this was most deﬁnitely not the case elsewhere. T o throw things
into relief, let’ s brieﬂy consider the slightly later palaces of mainland
Greece.
Cretan palaces were unfortiﬁed, and Minoan art makes almost no reference
to war , dwelling instead on scenes of play and attention to creature
comforts. All this is in marked contrast to what was happening on the Greek
mainland. W alled citadels arose at Mycenae, Pylos and T iryns around 1400
BC, and before long their rulers launched a successful takeover of Crete,
occupying Knossos and assuming control of its hinterland. Compared to
Knossos or Phaistos, their residences appear little more than hill forts,
perched on key passes in the Peloponnese and surrounded by modest
hamlets. Mycenae, the biggest, had a population of around 6,000. This is
not surprising, since the palace societies of the mainland don’ t arise from
pre-existing cities but from warrior aristocracies that produced the earlier
Shaft Graves of Mycenae, with their haunting gold death masks and
weaponry inlaid with scenes of male ﬁghters and hunting bands.150
On to this institutional foundation – the warrior band leader and his
hunting retinue – were soon added courtly ﬁnery borrowed mainly from the
Cretan palaces, and a script (Linear B) adapted to write the Greek language
for administration. Analysis of the Linear B tablets suggests that just a
handful of literate ofﬁcers did most of the administrative work themselves,
personally inspecting crops and livestock, gathering taxes, distributing raw
materials to artisans and supplying provisions for festivals. It was all rather
limited and small-scale,151 and a Mycenaean wanax  (the ruler or overlord)
would have exercised little true sovereignty beyond his citadel, making do
with seasonal tax raids on a surrounding populace whose lives otherwise
went on beyond the scope of royal surveillance.152
These Mycenaean overlords held court in a megar on or great hall, a
relatively well-preserved example of which exists at Pylos. Early
archaeologists were being a bit fanciful when they imagined this actually to
be the palace of the Homeric king Nestor , but there is no doubt one of
Homer ’s kings would have felt quite at home here. The megar on centred ona huge hearth, open to the sky; the remainder of the space, including the
throne, was most likely cast in shadow . The walls bear frescoes showing a
bull led to slaughter and a bard playing the lyre. The wanax , although not
depicted, is clearly the focus of these processional scenes, which conver ge
on his throne.153
We can contrast this with the ‘Throne Room’ of Knossos on Crete,
identiﬁed as such by Arthur Evans. In this case the purported throne faces
an open space, surrounded by stone benches symmetrically arranged in
rows so the assembled groups could sit in comfort for long periods, each
visible to all the others. Nearby was a stepped bathing chamber . There are
many such ‘lustral basins’ (as Evans called them) in Minoan houses and
palaces. Archaeologists puzzled for decades over their function, until at
Akrotiri one such was found directly under a painted scene of a female
initiation ceremony most likely linked to menstruation.154 In fact, on
purely architectural grounds, and notwithstanding Evans’ s rather desperate
insistence that it ‘seems better adapted for a man’, the centrepiece of the
Throne Room may be quite reasonably understood not as the seat of a male
monarch but rather that of a council head, and its occupants more likely a
succession of female councillors.
Pretty much all the available evidence from Minoan Crete suggests a
system of female political rule – ef fectively a theocracy of some sort,
governed by a college of priestesses. W e might ask: why are contemporary
researchers so resistant to this conclusion? One can’ t blame everything on
the fact that proponents of ‘primitive matriarchy’ made exaggerated claims
back in 1902. Y es, scholars tend to say that cities ruled by colleges of
priestesses are unprecedented in the ethnographic or historical record. But
by the same logic, one could equally point out that there is no parallel for a
kingdom run by men, in which all the visual representations of authority
ﬁgures are depictions of women. Something dif ferent was clearly happening
on Crete.
Certainly , the way in which Minoan artists represented life attests to a
profoundly dif ferent sensibility to that of Crete’ s neighbours on mainland
Greece. In an essay called ‘The Shapes of Minoan Desire’, Jack Dempsey
points out that erotic attention seems to be displaced from the female body
on to just about every other facet of life, starting with the lithe, scantily clad
ﬁgures of young men as they dart in and out of the bodies of bulls who
tease them, or gyrate in sporting activities, or the naked boys representedcarrying ﬁsh. It’ s all a world away from the stif f animal ﬁgures that
populate the walls of Pylos, or indeed those of Zimri-Lim’ s court, let alone
the scenes of brutal warfare on later Assyrian wall reliefs. In the Minoan
frescoes everything mer ges – except, that is, for the sharply delineated
ﬁgures of those leading females, who stand apart or in small groups,
happily chatting with one another or admiring some spectacle. Flowers and
reeds, birds, bees, dolphins, even hills and mountains are in the throes of a
perpetual dance, weaving in and out of each other .
Minoan objects too bleed into one another in an extraordinary play on
materials – a true ‘science of the concrete’ – that turns pottery into crusted
shell and melds the worlds of stone, metal and clay together into a common
realm of forms, each mimicking the others.
All this unfolds to the undulating rhythms of the sea, the eternal backdrop
to this garden of life, and all with a remarkable absence of ‘politics’, in our
sense, or what Dempsey calls the ‘self-perpetuating, power -hungry ego’.
What these scenes celebrate, as he eloquently puts it, is quite the opposite of
politics: it is the ‘ritually induced release from individuality , and an ecstasy
of being that is overtly erotic and spiritual at the same time ( ek-stasis ,
“standing beyond oneself”) – a cosmos that both nurtures and ignores the
individual, that vibrates with inseparable sexual ener gies and spiritual
epiphanies’. There are no heroes in Minoan art – only players. Crete of the
palaces was the realm of Homo ludens . Or perhaps, better said, Femina
ludens  – not to mention Femina potens .155
What we’ve learned in this chapter can be brieﬂy summarized. The process
usually called ‘state formation’ can in fact mean a bewildering number of
very dif ferent things. It can mean a game of honour or chance gone terribly
wrong, or the incorrigible growth of a particular ritual for feeding the dead;
it can mean industrial slaughter , the appropriation by men of female
knowledge, or governance by a college of priestesses. But we’ve also
learned that when studied and compared more closely , the range of
possibilities is far from limitless.
In fact, there seem to be both logical and historical constraints on the
variety of ways in which power can expand its scope; these limits are the
basis of our ‘three principles’ of sovereignty , administration and
competitive politics. What we can also see, though, is that – even within
these constraints – there were far more interesting things going on than wemight ever have guessed by sticking to any conventional deﬁnition of ‘the
state’. What was really happening in the Minoan palaces? They seem to
have been in some sense theatrical stages, in some sense women’ s initiation
societies, and administrative hubs all at the same time. W ere they even a
regime of domination at all?
It’s also important to recall the very uneven nature of the evidence we’ve
been dealing with. What would we be saying about Minoan Crete, or
Teotihuacan, or Çatalhöyük for that matter , were it not for the fact that their
elaborate wall paintings happen to have been preserved? More than almost
any other form of human activity , painting on walls is something people in
virtually any cultural setting seem inclined to do. This has been true almost
since the beginnings of humanity itself. W e can hardly doubt that similar
images were produced, on skins and fabrics as well as directly on walls, in
any number of so-called ‘early states’ from which only bare stone building
blocks or mud-brick enclosures now survive.
Archaeology , using a barrage of new scientiﬁc techniques, will
undoubtedly reveal many more such ‘lost civilizations’, as it is already in
the process of doing, from the deserts of Saudi Arabia or Peru to the once
seemingly empty steppes of Kazakhstan and the tropical forests of
Amazonia. As the evidence accumulates, year on year , for lar ge settlements
and impressive structures in previously unsuspected locations, we’d be wise
to resist projecting some image of the modern nation state on to their bare
surfaces, and consider what other kinds of social possibilities they might
attest to.1 1
Full Circle
On the historical foundations of the indigenous critique
We appear to have come a long way from where this book began, with the
Wendat statesman Kandiaronk and the critique of European civilization that
developed among indigenous people in North America during the
seventeenth century . Now it’ s time to bring the story full circle. Recall how ,
by the eighteenth century , the indigenous critique – and the deep questions
it posed about money , faith, hereditary power , women’ s rights and personal
freedoms – was having an enormous inﬂuence on leading ﬁgures of the
French Enlightenment, but also resulted in a backlash among European
thinkers which produced an evolutionary framework for human history that
remains broadly intact today . Portraying history as a story of material
progress, that framework recast indigenous critics as innocent children of
nature, whose views on freedom were a mere side ef fect of their
uncultivated way of life and could not possibly of fer a serious challenge to
contemporary social thought (which came increasingly to mean just
European thought).1
In reality , we have not strayed far at all from this starting point, because
the conventional wisdom we’ve been challenging throughout this book –
about hunter -gatherer societies, the consequences of farming, the rise of
cities and states – has its genesis right there: with T urgot, Smith and the
reaction against the indigenous critique. Of course, the idea that human
societies evolved over time was not particularly special to the eighteenth
century , or to Europe.2 What was new in the version of world history put
forward by European writers of that century was an insistence on
classifying societies by means of subsistence (so that agriculture could be
seen as a fundamental break in the history of human af fairs); an assumption
that as societies grew lar ger, they inevitably grew more complex; and that‘complexity’ means not just a greater dif ferentiation of functions, but also
the reor ganization of human societies into hierarchical ranks, governed
from the top down.
This European backlash was so ef fective that generations of
philosophers, historians, social scientists, and almost anyone else since who
wishes to address the human story on a broad scale, feels secure in their
knowledge of how it should properly start and where it is leading. It begins
with an imaginary collection of tiny hunter -gatherer bands and ends with
the current collection of capitalist nation states (or some projection of what
might come after them). Anything going on in between can be considered
interesting – mainly insofar as it contributed to moving us all on down that
particular pathway . As we’ve been discovering, one consequence is that
huge swathes of the human past disappear from the purview of history , or
remain ef fectively invisible (except to the eyes of a tiny number of
researchers, who rarely explain the implications of their ﬁndings to each
other , let alone to anyone else).
Since the 1980s it has been commonplace for social theorists to claim we
are living in a new ‘post-modern’ age, marked by a suspicion towards
metanarratives. This claim is often used as justiﬁcation for a sort of hyper -
specialization: to cast one’ s intellectual net wider – to compare notes with
colleagues in other ﬁelds, even – smacks of imposing a single, imperialistic
vision of history . For this very reason, the ‘idea of progress’ is usually held
up as a prime example of the way we no longer think about history and
society . But such claims are odd, since almost everyone making them
nonetheless continues to think in evolutionary terms. W e could go further:
thinkers who do seek to knit together the ﬁndings of specialists, to describe
the course of human history on a grand scale, haven’ t entirely got past the
biblical notion of the Garden of Eden, the Fall and subsequent inevitability
of domination. Blinded by the ‘just so’ story of how human societies
evolved, they can’ t even see half of what’ s now before their eyes.
As a result, the same portrayers of world history who profess themselves
believers in freedom, democracy and women’ s rights continue to treat
historical epochs of relative freedom, democracy and women’ s rights as so
many ‘dark ages’. Similarly , as we’ve seen, the concept of ‘civilization’ is
still lar gely reserved for societies whose deﬁning characteristics include
high-handed autocrats, imperial conquests and the use of slave labour .
Presented with undeniable cases of lar ge and materially sophisticatedsocieties for which evidence of such things is conspicuously lacking –
ancient centres like T eotihuacan or Knossos, for example – the standard
recourse is to throw up one’ s hands and say: who can tell what was really
going on there? or insist that Ozymandias’ throne room must be lurking in
there somewhere, but that we simply haven’ t found it yet.
IN WHICH WE CONSIDER JAMES C. SCOTT’S ARGUMENTS
ABOUT THE LAST 5,000 YEARS AND ASK WHETHER
CURRENT GLOBAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE, IN F ACT ,
INEVIT ABLE
You may object: perhaps much of human history was more complicated
than we usually admit, but surely what matters is how things ended up. For
at least 2,000 years, most of the world’ s population have been living under
kings or emperors of one sort or another . Even in places where monarchy
did not exist – much of Africa or Oceania, for example – we ﬁnd that (at the
very least) patriarchy , and often violent domination of other sorts, have
been widespread. Once established, such institutions are very hard to get rid
of. So your objection might run: all you’re saying is that the inevitable took
a little longer to happen. That doesn’ t make it any less inevitable.
Similarly , with farming. T rue, your objection might run: agriculture
might not have transformed everything overnight, but surely it laid the
groundwork for later systems of domination? W asn’t it really just a matter
of time? Did not the very possibility of piling up lar ge surpluses of grain, in
effect, lay a trap? W asn’t it inevitable that, sooner or later , some warrior -
prince like Narmer of Egypt would begin amassing stockpiles for his
henchmen? And once he did, surely the game was over . Rival kingdoms
and empires would quickly come into being. Some would ﬁnd the means to
expand; they would insist on their subjects producing more and more grain,
and those subjects would grow in number , even as the number of remaining
free peoples tended to remain stable. Once again, was it not just a matter of
time before one of those kingdoms (or , as it turned out, a small collection of
them) came up with a successful formula for world conquest – just the right
combination of guns, germs and steel – and imposed its system on
everybody else?
James Scott – a renowned political scientist who has devoted much of his
career to understanding the role of states (and those who succeed in evadingthem) in human history – has a compelling description of how this
agricultural trap works. The Neolithic, he suggests, began with ﬂood-retreat
agriculture, which was easy work and encouraged redistribution; the lar gest
populations were, indeed, concentrated in deltaic environments, but the ﬁrst
states in the Middle East (he concentrates lar gely on these; and China)
developed upriver , in areas with an especially strong focus on cereal
agriculture – wheat, barley , millet – and relatively limited access to a range
of other staples. The key to the importance of grain, Scott notes, is that it
was durable, portable, easily divisible and quantiﬁable by bulk, and
therefore an ideal medium to serve as a basis for taxation. Growing above
ground – unlike, say , certain tubers or legumes – grain crops were also
highly visible and amenable to appropriation. Cereal agriculture did not
cause the rise of extractive states, but it was certainly predisposed to their
ﬁscal requirements.3
Like money , grain allows a certain form of terrifying equivalence.
Whatever the reasons why it initially became a predominant crop in a given
region (as we’ve seen – in Egypt for example – this had much to do with
changes in rituals for the dead), once this happened a permanent kingdom
could always emer ge. However , Scott also points out that for much of
history this process turned out to be a trap for these newfound ‘grain states’
as well, limiting them to areas that favoured intensive agriculture, and
leaving surrounding highlands, fenlands and marshes lar gely beyond their
reach.4 What’ s more, even within those conﬁnes the grain-based kingdoms
were fragile, always prone to collapse under the weight of over -population,
ecological devastation and the kind of endemic diseases that always seemed
to result when too many humans, domesticated animals and parasites
accumulated in one place.
Ultimately , though, Scott’ s focus isn’ t really on states at all: it’ s about the
‘barbarians’ – a term Scott uses for all those groups which came to surround
the little islands of authoritarian-bureaucratic rule, and which existed in a
largely symbiotic relation with them: some ever -shifting mix of raiding,
trading and mutual avoidance. As Scott ar gued about the hill peoples of
Southeast Asia, some of these ‘barbarians’ became, ef fectively , anarchists:
organizing their lives in explicit opposition to the valley societies below , or
to prevent the emer gence of stratiﬁed classes in their own midst. As we’ve
seen, such conscious rejection of bureaucratic values – another example of
cultural schismogenesis – could also give rise to ‘heroic societies’, a hurly-burly of petty lords whose pre-eminence was founded on dramatic contests
of war , feasting, boasting, duelling, games, gifts and sacriﬁce. Monarchy
itself is likely to have started that way , on the fringes of urban-bureaucratic
systems.
But to continue with Scott: barbarian monarchies remained either small-
scale or , if they did expand – as was spectacularly the case under ﬁgures
like Alaric, Attila, Genghis or T amerlane – the expansion was short-lived.
Throughout much of history , grain states and barbarians remained ‘dark
twins’, locked together in an unresolvable tension, since neither could break
out of their ecological niches. When the states had the upper hand, slaves
and mercenaries ﬂowed in one direction; when the barbarians were
dominant, tribute ﬂowed to appease the most dangerous warlord; or
alternatively , some overlord would manage to or ganize an ef fective
coalition, sweep in on the cities and either lay waste to them, or more
typically , attempt to rule them, and inevitably ﬁnd himself and his retinue
absorbed as a new governing class. As the Mongolian adage went, ‘One can
conquer a kingdom on horseback, to rule it one must dismount.’
Scott, though, doesn’ t draw any particular conclusions. Rather , he simply
remarks that while the period from about 3000 BC to AD 1600 was a fairly
miserable one for the bulk of the world’ s farmers, it was a Golden Age for
the barbarians, who reaped all the advantages of their proximity to dynastic
states and empires (luxuries to loot and plunder), while themselves living
comparatively easy lives. And it was usually possible for at least some of
the oppressed to join their ranks. For most of history , he suggests, this is
what rebellion typically looked like: defection to join the ranks of nearby
barbarians. T o put the matter in our own terms, while these agrarian
kingdoms managed lar gely to abolish the freedom to ignore orders, they had
a much harder time abolishing the freedom to move away . Empires were
exceptional and short-lived, and even the most powerful – Roman, Han,
Ming, Inca – could not prevent lar ge-scale movements of people into and
out of their spheres of control. Until around a half-millennium ago, a lar ge
proportion of the world’ s population still lived either beyond the tax
collector ’s purview or within reach of some relatively straightforward
means of escaping it.5
Yet today , in our twenty-ﬁrst-century world, this is obviously no longer
the case. Something did go terribly wrong – at least from the point of view
of the barbarians. W e no longer live in that world. But merely recognizingthat it existed for so long allows us to pose a further important question.
How inevitable, really , were the type of governments we have today , with
their particular fusion of territorial sovereignty , intense administration and
competitive politics? W as this really the necessary culmination of human
history?
One problem with evolutionism is that it takes ways of life that developed
in symbiotic relation with each other and reor ganizes them into separate
stages of human history . By the late nineteenth century , it was becoming
clear that the original sequence as developed by T urgot and others –
hunting, pastoralism, agriculture, then ﬁnally industrial civilization – didn’ t
really work. Y et at the same time, the publication of Darwin’ s theories
meant that evolutionism became entrenched as the only possible scientiﬁc
approach to history – or at least the only one likely to be given credence in
universities. So the search was on for more workable categories. In his 1877
Ancient Society , Lewis Henry Mor gan proposed a series of steps from
‘savagery’ through ‘barbarism’ to ‘civilization’ which was widely adopted
in the new ﬁeld of anthropology . Meanwhile, Marxists concentrated on
forms of domination, and the move out of primitive communism towards
slavery , feudalism and capitalism, to be followed by socialism (then
communism). All these approaches were basically unworkable, and
eventually had to be thrown away as well.
Since the 1950s, a body of neo-evolutionist theory has sought to deﬁne a
new version of the sequence, based on how efﬁciently groups harvest
energy from their environment.6 As we’ve seen, almost nobody today
subscribes to this framework in its entirety . Indeed, whole volumes have
been written taking it to task, or pointing out the many exceptions to its
logic; we are ‘over all that’ and have ‘moved on’ would be the standard
reaction of most anthropologists and archaeologists when confronted with
such an evolutionary scheme today . But if our ﬁelds have moved on, they
have done so, it seems, without putting any alternative vision in place, the
result being that almost anyone who is not an archaeologist or
anthropologist tends to fall back on the older scheme when they set out to
think or write about world history on a lar ge canvas. For this reason it might
be useful to summarize the older scheme’ s basic sequence here:Band societies:  the simplest stage is still assumed to be made up of hunter -
gatherers like the !Kung or Hadza, supposedly living in small mobile
groups of twenty to forty individuals, without any formal political roles and
minimal division of labour . Such societies are thought to be egalitarian,
effectively by default.
Tribes:  societies like the Nuer , Dayaks or Kayapo. T ribesmen are typically
assumed to be ‘horticulturalists’, which is to say they farm but don’ t create
irrigation works or use heavy equipment like ploughs; they are egalitarian,
at least among those of the same age and gender; their leaders have only
informal, or at least no coercive, power . ‘Tribes’ are typically arranged into
the sort of complex lineage or totemic clan structures beloved of
anthropologists. Economically , the central ﬁgures are ‘big men’ – such as
were typically found in Melanesia – responsible for creating voluntary
coalitions of contributors to sponsor rituals and feasts. Ritual or craft
specialism is limited and usually part-time; tribes are numerically lar ger
than bands, but settlements tend to be roughly of the same size and
importance.
Chiefdoms:  while the clans of tribal society are all, ultimately , equivalent,
in chiefdoms the kinship system becomes the basis for a system of rank,
with aristocrats, commoners and even slaves. The Shilluk, Natchez or
Calusa are typically treated as chiefdoms; so are, say , Polynesian kingdoms,
or the lords of ancient Gaul. Intensiﬁcation of production leads to a
signiﬁcant surplus, and classes of full-time craft and ritual specialists
emer ge, not to mention the chieﬂy families themselves. There is at least one
level of settlement hierarchy (the chief ’s residence, and everyone else), and
the main economic function of the chief is redistributive: pooling resources,
often forcibly , and then doling them out to everyone, usually during
spectacular feasts.
States:  much as already described, these tend to be characterized by
intensive cereal agriculture, a legal monopoly on the use of force,
professional administration and a complex division of labour .
As many twentieth-century anthropologists pointed out at the time, this
scheme doesn’ t really work either . In reality , ‘big men’ seem almost entirely
conﬁned to Melanesia. ‘Indian chiefs’ such as Geronimo or Sitting Bullwere, in fact, tribal headmen, whose role was nothing like big men in Papua
New Guinea. Most of those labelled ‘chiefs’ in the neo-evolutionist model,
as we’ve already noted, look suspiciously like what we normally think of as
‘kings’ and may well live in fortiﬁed castles, wear ermine robes, support
court jesters, have hundreds of wives and harem eunuchs. However , they
rarely engage in the mass redistribution of resources, at least not in any
systematic way .
The evolutionist response to such critiques was not to abandon the
scheme but to ﬁne-tune it. Perhaps chiefdoms are more predatory ,
evolutionists ar gued, but they are still fundamentally dif ferent to states.
What’ s more, they can be subdivided between ‘simple’ and ‘complex’
chiefdoms: in the former , the chief really was just a gloriﬁed big man, still
working like everyone else, with only minimal administrative assistance; in
the complex version, he was backed up by at least two levels of
administrative staf f, allowing a genuine class structure. Finally , chiefdoms
‘cycled’, which is to say that the simple overlords were constantly , often
quite methodically , trying to patch together tiny empires by conquering or
subordinating local rivals, so as to catapult themselves towards the next
stage of complexity (characterized by three levels of administrative
hierarchy), or even to found states. While a few ambitious chiefs did
manage to pull this of f, most failed; they reached their ecological or social
limits; this rankled with people; the whole jerry-built contraption collapsed,
leaving it for some other aspiring dynast to begin trying to conquer the
world – or at least, those parts of it considered worth conquering.
In academic circles, an odd disjuncture has developed around the use of
such schemes. Most cultural anthropologists view this kind of evolutionary
thinking as a sort of quaint relic from their discipline’ s past, which no one
today could possibly take seriously; while most archaeologists only employ
terms like ‘tribe’, ‘chiefdom’ or ‘state’ for lack of an alternative
terminology . Yet almost anyone else will treat such schemes as the self-
evident basis for all further discussion. Throughout this book, we have
spent a good deal of time demonstrating how deceptive all this is. The
reason why these ways of thinking remain in place, no matter how many
times people point out their incoherence, is precisely because we ﬁnd it so
difﬁcult to imagine history that isn’ t teleological – that is, to or ganize
history in a way which does not imply that current arrangements were
somehow inevitable.As we have already remarked, one of the most puzzling aspects of living
in history is that it’ s almost impossible to predict the course of future
events; yet, once events have happened, it’ s difﬁcult to know what it would
even mean to say something else ‘could’ have happened. A properly
historical event has, perhaps, two qualities: it could not have been predicted
beforehand, but it only happens once. One does not get to ﬁght the Battle of
Gaugamela over again, to see what would have happened if Darius had
actually won. Speculating what might have happened – had Alexander , say,
been hit by a stray arrow , and there had never been a Ptolemaic Egypt or
Seleucid Syria – is at best an idle game. It might raise profound questions –
how much dif ference can an individual really make in history? – but
nevertheless, these are questions that cannot ever be deﬁnitively answered.
The best we can do, when confronted with unique historical events or
conﬁgurations such as the Persian or Hellenistic empires, is to engage in a
project of comparison. This at least can give us an idea of the sort of things
that might  happen, and at best a sense of the pattern by which one thing is
likely to follow another . The problem is that ever since the Iberian invasion
of the Americas, and subsequent European colonial empires, we can’ t even
really do that, because there’ s ultimately been just one political-economic
system and it is global. If we wish, say , to assess whether the modern nation
state, industrial capitalism and the spread of lunatic asylums are necessarily
linked, as opposed to separate phenomena that just happen to have come
together in one part of the world, there’ s simply no basis on which to
judge.7 All three emer ged at a time when the planet was ef fectively a single
global system and we have no other planets to compare ourselves to.
One could make the ar gument – many do – that for most of human
history this was already the case. Eurasia and Africa already formed a
single interconnected system. Certainly , people, objects and ideas did move
back and forth across the Indian Ocean and the Silk Roads (or their Bronze
and Iron Age precursors); as a result, dramatic political and economic
changes often appeared to occur in more or less co-ordinated fashion across
the Eurasian land mass. T o take one famous example: almost a century ago,
the German philosopher Karl Jaspers noted that all the major schools of
speculative philosophy we know today seem to have emer ged – apparently
independently – in Greece, India and China at roughly the same time,
between the eighth and third centuries BC; what’ s more, they emer ged in
precisely those cities which had recently seen the invention and widespreadadoption of coined money . Jaspers called this the Axial Age, a term since
expanded by others to include the period that saw the birth of all today’ s
world religions, stretching from the Persian prophet Zoroaster ( c.800 BC) to
the coming of Islam ( c. AD 600). Now , the core period of Jaspers’ s Axial
Age – encompassing the lifetimes of Pythagoras, the Buddha and Confucius
– corresponds not only to the invention of metal coinage and new forms of
speculative thought, but also the spread of chattel slavery across Eurasia,
even in places where it had barely existed before; moreover , chattel slavery
would eventually fall into decline after a succession of Axial Age empires
dissolved (the Maurya, Han, Parthian, Roman), along with their prevailing
systems of currency .8 Obviously , it would be wrong to say that Eurasia can
be treated as just one place, and therefore to conclude that comparing how
these processes unfolded in dif ferent parts of Eurasia is meaningless.
Equally , it would be wrong to conclude that such patterns are universal
features of human development. They might just be what happened in
Eurasia.
Much of Africa, Oceania or northwestern Europe for that matter , was so
tied into the great empires of this period – notably with the conver gence of
terrestrial and maritime trade routes around the Indian Ocean and
Mediterranean in the ﬁfth century BC, but ar guably already much earlier –
that it’ s hard to know whether they can be taken as independent points of
comparison either . The only real exception were the Americas. Admittedly ,
even before 1492 there must have been some occasional movement back
and forth between the two hemispheres (otherwise there wouldn’ t have been
a human population in the Americas to begin with); but prior to the Iberian
invasion, the Americas were not in direct or regular communication with
Eurasia. They were in no sense part of the same ‘world system’. This is
important, because it means we do have one truly independent point of
comparison (possibly even two, if we consider North and South America as
separate), where it is possible to ask: does history really have to take a
certain direction?
In the case of the Americas, we actually can pose questions such as: was
the rise of monarchy as the world’ s predominant form of government
inevitable? Is cereal agriculture really a trap, and can one really say that
once the farming of wheat or rice or maize becomes sufﬁciently
widespread, it’ s only a matter of time before some enterprising overlord
seizes control of the granaries and establishes a regime of bureaucraticallyadministered violence? And once he does, is it inevitable that others will
imitate his example? Judging by the history of pre-Columbian North
America, at least, the answer to all these questions is a resounding ‘no’.
In fact, although archaeologists of North America use the language of
‘bands’, ‘tribes’, ‘chiefdoms’ and ‘states,’ what actually seems to have
happened there deﬁes all such assumptions. W e’ve already seen how in the
western half of the continent there was, if anything, a movement away  from
agriculture in the centuries before the European invasion; and how Plains
societies often seem to have moved back and forth, over the course of any
given year , between bands and something that shares at least some of the
features we identify with states – in other words, between what should have
been opposite ends of the scale of social evolution. Even more startling in
its own way is what happened in the eastern part of the continent.
From roughly AD 1050 to 1350 there was, in what’ s now East St Louis, a
city whose real name has been for gotten, but which is known to history as
Cahokia.9 It appears to have been the capital of what James Scott would
term a classic budding ‘grain state’, rising magniﬁcently and seemingly
from nowhere, around the time that the Song Dynasty ruled in China and
the Abbasid Caliphate in Iraq. Cahokia’ s population peaked at something in
the order of 15,000 people; then it abruptly dissolved. Whatever Cahokia
represented in the eyes of those under its sway , it seems to have ended up
being overwhelmingly and resoundingly rejected by the vast majority of its
people. For centuries after its demise the site where the city once stood, and
hundreds of miles of river valleys around it, lay entirely devoid of human
habitation: a ‘vacant quarter ’ (rather like the Forbidden Zone in Pierre
Boulle’ s Planet of the Apes ), a place of ruins and bitter memories.10
Successor kingdoms to Cahokia sprang up to the south but then likewise
crumbled. By the time Europeans arrived on the eastern seaboard of North
America, ‘Mississippian civilization’ – as it has come to be known – was
but a distant memory and the descendants of Cahokia’ s subjects and
neighbours appear to have reor ganized themselves into polis -sized tribal
republics, in careful ecological balance with their natural environment.
What had happened? W ere the rulers of Cahokia and other Mississippian
cities overthrown by popular uprisings, undermined by mass defection,
victims of ecological catastrophe, or (more likely) some intricate mix of all
three? Archaeology may one day supply more deﬁnitive answers. Until
such time, what we can say with some conﬁdence is that the societiesencountered by European invaders from the sixteenth century onwards were
the product of centuries of political conﬂict and self-conscious debate. They
were, in many cases, societies in which the ability to engage in self-
conscious political debate was itself considered one of the highest human
values.
It is impossible to understand the devotion to individual liberty , or even
the sceptical rationalism of ﬁgures like Kandiaronk, outside this lar ger
historical context; or at least, that is what we propose to show in the rest of
this chapter . Much though later European authors liked to imagine them as
innocent children of nature, the indigenous populations of North America
were in fact heirs to their own, long intellectual and political history – one
that had taken them in a very dif ferent direction to Eurasian philosophers
and which, ar guably , ended up having a profound inﬂuence on conceptions
of freedom and equality , not just in Europe but everywhere else as well.Of course, we are taught to treat such claims as inherently unlikely , even
slightly preposterous. As we’ve seen in the case of T urgot, evolutionary
theory as we know it today was lar gely created so as to entrench such
dismissive attitudes: to make them seem natural or obvious. If the
indigenous peoples of North America aren’ t being imagined as living in a
separate time, or as vestiges of some earlier stage of human history , then
they’re imagined as living in an entirely separate reality (‘ontology’ is the
currently fashionable term), a mythic consciousness fundamentally dif ferent
from our own. If nothing else, it is assumed that any intellectual tradition
similar to that which produced Plotinus, Shankara or Zhuang Zu can only
be the product of a literary tradition in which knowledge becomes
cumulative. And since North America did not produce a written tradition –
or at least not the sort we are used to recognizing as such1 1 – any
knowledge it generated, political or otherwise, was necessarily of a dif ferent
kind. Any similarity we might see to debates or positions familiar from our
own intellectual tradition is typically written of f as some sort of naive
projection of W estern categories. Real dialogue is thus impossible.
Perhaps the most straightforward way to counteract this sort of ar gument
is by citing a text, which describes a concept the W endat (Huron) called
Ondinnonk , a secret desire of the soul manifested by a dream:
Hurons believe that our souls have other desires, which are, as it
were, inborn and concealed … They believe that our soul makes
these natural desires known by means of dreams, which are its
language. Accordingly , when these desires are accomplished, it is
satisﬁed; but, on the contrary , if it be not granted what it desires, it
becomes angry , and not only does not give its body the good and the
happiness that it wished to procure for it, but often it also revolts
against the body , causing various diseases, and even death.12
The author goes on to explain that, in dreams, such secret desires are
communicated in a kind of indirect, symbolic language, difﬁcult tounderstand, and that the W endat therefore spend a great deal of time trying
to decipher the meaning of one another ’s dreams, or consulting specialists.
All this might seem like an oddly clumsy projection of Freudian theory ,
but for one thing. The text is from 1649. It was written by a certain Father
Ragueneau in a Jesuit Relation , precisely 250 years before the appearance
of the ﬁrst edition of Freud’ s The Interpr etation of Dr eams  (1899), an event
which, like Einstein’ s theory of relativity , is widely seen as one of the
founding events of twentieth-century thought. What’ s more, Ragueneau is
not our only source. Numerous missionaries attempting to convert other
Iroquoian peoples at the same time reported similar theories – which they
considered absurd and obviously false (though probably , they concluded,
not actually demonic) and attempted to refute, in order to bring their
interlocutors around instead to the truth of Holy Scripture.
Does this mean that the community in which Kandiaronk grew up was
composed of Freudians? Not exactly . There were signiﬁcant dif ferences
between Freudian psychoanalysis and Iroquoian practice, most dramatically
in the collective nature of the therapy . ‘Dream-guessing’ was often carried
out by groups, and realizing the desires of the dreamer , either literally or
symbolically , could involve mobilizing an entire community: Ragueneau
reported that the winter months in a W endat town were lar gely devoted to
organizing collective feasts and dramas, literally in order to make some
important man or woman’ s dreams come true. The point here is that it
would be very unwise to dismiss such intellectual traditions as inferior – or
for that matter , entirely alien – to our own.
One thing that makes the W endat and Haudenosaunee unusual is that
their traditions are so well documented: many other societies were either
entirely destroyed, or reduced to traumatized remnants, long before any
such records could be written down. One can only wonder what other
intellectual traditions might thus have been forever lost. What we are going
to do in the remainder of this chapter , then, is examine the history of the
Eastern W oodlands of North America from roughly AD 200 to 1600 in
exactly this light. Our aim here is to understand the local roots of the
indigenous critique of European civilization, and how those roots were
entangled in a history that began at Cahokia or perhaps even considerably
earlier .IN WHICH WE ASK HOW MUCH OF NOR TH AMERICA CAME
TO HA VE A SINGLE UNIFORM CLAN SYSTEM, AND
CONSIDER THE ROLE OF THE ‘HOPEWELL INTERACTION
SPHERE’
Let’s start with a puzzle. W e’ve already had occasion to mention how the
same basic repertoire of clan names could be found distributed more or less
everywhere across T urtle Island (the indigenous name for the North
American continent). There were endless local dif ferences, but there were
also consistent alliances, so that it was possible for a traveller hailing from a
Bear, or W olf or Hawk clan in what’ s now Geor gia to travel all the way to
Ontario or Arizona and ﬁnd someone obliged to host them at almost any
point in between. This seems all the more remarkable when one considers
that literally hundreds of dif ferent languages were spoken in North
America, belonging to half a dozen completely unrelated language families.
It hardly seems likely that clan systems were brought over , fully ﬂedged,
with the ﬁrst human arrivals from Siberia; they must have developed in
more recent times. But – and here’ s our puzzle – considering the distances
involved, it’ s hard to imagine how that could have happened.
As Elizabeth T ooker , doyenne of Iroquoian studies, pointed out back in
the 1970s, this puzzle is all the more perplexing because it’ s not entirely
clear if North American clans should strictly be considered ‘kinship’ groups
at all. They are more like ritual societies, each dedicated to maintaining a
spiritual relation with a dif ferent totem animal which is usually only
ﬁguratively their ‘ancestor ’. True, members are recruited by (matrilineal or
patrilineal) descent, and fellow clan members consider one another brothers
and sisters whom one therefore cannot marry . Yet nobody kept track of
genealogies, and there were no ancestor cults or property claims based on
descent: all clan members were, ef fectively , equal. There wasn’ t even much
in the way of collective property other than certain forms of ritual
knowledge, dances or chants, bundles of sacred objects and also a collection
of names.
A clan typically had a ﬁxed stock of names which were assigned to
children. Some of these were chieﬂy names but, like the sacred
paraphernalia, they were rarely directly inherited; instead, they were
assigned to the most likely candidate when a title holder died. A
community , moreover , was never made up of just one clan. There wereusually quite a number , grouped together into two halves (or moieties),
which acted as rivals and complements to one another , competing against
one another in sports and burying one another ’s dead. The overall ef fect
was to ef face personal histories from public contexts: since names were
titles, it would be as if the head of one half of the community would always
be John F . Kennedy and the other always Richard Nixon. This fusing of
titles and names is a peculiarly North American phenomenon. Some version
of it appears almost everywhere on T urtle Island, but almost nowhere else
in the world do we see anything quite like it.
Finally , Tooker notes, clans played a key role in diplomacy: not just in
providing hospitality to travellers, but or ganizing the protocol for
diplomatic missions, the paying of compensation to prevent wars, or the
incorporation of prisoners, who could simply be assigned a name and
thereby become a clan member in their new community – even the
replacement for someone who had died in that very conﬂict. The system
appeared to be designed to maximize people’ s capacity to move,
individually or collectively , or for that matter to reshufﬂe social
arrangements. W ithin these parameters there is an endless, almost
kaleidoscopic range of possibilities. But where did this set of parameters
come from in the ﬁrst place? T ooker suggested it might be remnants of
some long-for gotten ‘trading empire’, perhaps originally established by
merchants from central Mexico, but the suggestion wasn’ t taken seriously
by her fellow scholars – her essay , in fact, is hardly ever cited. There is no
evidence that any such trading empire ever existed.
It seems more reasonable to assume that a ritual and diplomatic system
has its origins in, well, ritual and diplomacy . The ﬁrst point where we have
unmistakable evidence that such a phenomenon could  have happened – that
is, where active ties developed between virtually all parts of North America
– lies in what archaeologists refer to as the ‘Hopewell Interaction Sphere’, a
network with its epicentre in the Scioto and Paint Creek river valleys of
Ohio. Between roughly 100 BC and AD 500, communities participating in
this network deposited treasures under burial mounds, often piled up in
extraordinary quantities. The treasures included quartz-crystal arrowheads,
mica and obsidian from the Appalachians, copper and silver from the Great
Lakes, conch shells and shark teeth from Gulf of Mexico, grizzly-bear
molars from the Rockies, meteoric iron, alligator teeth, barracuda jaws and
more.13 Most of these materials seem to have been used for themanufacture of ritual gear and magniﬁcent costumes – including metal-
sheathed pipes and mirrors – worn by shamans, priests and a host of minor
ofﬁcials in a complex or ganizational structure, the precise nature of which
is ﬁendishly difﬁcult to reconstruct.
Even more striking, many of these tombs were located in the vicinity of
gigantic earthworks, some literally miles across. The inhabitants of the
Central Ohio valley had been creating such structures since the beginning of
what archaeologists called the Adena period, around 1000 BC, and
earthworks do also appear in earlier ‘Archaic’ phases of North American
history . As we’ve already seen in the case of Poverty Point, whoever
designed them was capable of making remarkably sophisticated
astronomical calculations and employed accurate systems of measurement.
One would imagine such people could also marshal and deploy enormous
amounts of labour – although here we must be careful. Evidence from more
recent times suggests that the tradition of mound-building could have been,
in some cases, a side ef fect of creating dancing-grounds or other ﬂat open
spaces for feasts, games and assemblies. Each year before a major ritual
these spaces would be swept and ﬂattened, and the accumulated dirt and
debris piled up in the same place. Over centuries, this could obviously
become a very lar ge amount of material to be shaped. Among the
Muskogee, for example, such artiﬁcial hills would be covered each year by
a new mantle of red, yellow , black or white earth. This work was or ganized
by ofﬁcials on rotating duties and did not require top-down structures of
command.14
Such is clearly not the case, however , with really lar ge structures like
Poverty Point or the Hopewell earthworks. These did not grow by slow
accretion but were planned in advance. The most impressive sites are
almost invariably in river valleys, typically quite close to bodies of water .
They rise, literally , out of the sodden mud. As anyone who has played as a
child with sand or mud (that is, pretty much anyone, including ancient
Amerindians) will be aware, it’ s easy to make structures out of such
material, but almost impossible to keep them from crumbling or washing
away again in damp locations. This is where the really impressive
engineering comes in. A typical Hopewell site is a complex, mathematically
aligned mix of circles, squares and octagons – all made of mud. One of the
largest, the Newark Earthworks in Licking County , Ohio, which apparently
functioned as a lunar observatory , extends over two square miles andcontains embankments more than sixteen feet tall. The only way to create
stable structures of this sort – so stable that they still exist today – was by
the use of ingenious building techniques, alternating layers of earth with
carefully selected gravels and sand.15 To anyone seeing them for the ﬁrst
time, rising above the swamps, the ef fect would be similar to witnessing an
ice cube that refused ever to melt in the midday sun; a kind of cosmogonic
miracle.
We’ve already mentioned how researchers calculating the maths were
startled to discover that, from the Archaic phase onwards, geometric
earthworks across lar ge parts of the Americas appear to have been using the
same system of measurement: one apparently based on the arrangement of
cords into equilateral triangles. So the fact that people and materials were
conver ging from far and wide upon the Hopewell mound complexes is not
in itself extraordinary . Yet as archaeologists have also observed, the
geometric systems characteristic of the ‘W oodland peoples’ who created
Hopewell also mark something of a break with past custom: the
introduction of a dif ferent metrical system, and a new geometry of forms.16
Central Ohio was just the epicentre. Sites with earthworks based on this
new, Hopewellian geometrical system can be found dotted along the upper
and lower reaches of the Mississippi valley . Some are the size of small
towns. They might, and often did, contain meeting houses, craft workshops
and charnel houses for the processing of human remains, along with crypts
for the dead. A few might have had resident caretakers, though this isn’ t
entirely clear . What is clear is that for most of the year these sites remained
largely or completely empty . Only on speciﬁc ritual occasions did they
come to life as theatres for elaborate ceremonies, densely populated for a
week or two at a time, with people drawn from across the region and
occasional visitors from very far away .
This is another of the puzzles of Hopewell. It had all the elements
required to create a classic ‘grain state’ (as Scott would deﬁne it). The
Scioto-Paint Creek bottomlands, where the lar gest centres were built, are so
fertile they later came to be nicknamed ‘Egypt’ by European settlers; and at
least some of the inhabitants will have been familiar with maize cultivation.
But in the same way that they appear to have lar gely avoided this crop –
except perhaps for limited, ritual purposes – they also lar gely avoided the
valley bottoms, preferring to live in isolated homesteads scattered across the
landscape and mostly on higher ground. Such homesteads often consisted ofa single family; or , at most, three or four . Sometimes these tiny groups
moved back and forth between summer and winter houses, pursuing a
combination of hunting, ﬁshing, foraging and cultivating local weedy crops
in small garden plots; sunﬂowers, sumpweed, goosefoot, knotweed and
maygrass, along with a smattering of vegetables.17 Presumably people
were in regular contact with their neighbours. They seem to have got on
with them well enough, since there is little evidence for warfare or
organized violence of any sort.18 But they never came together to create
any sort of ongoing village or town life.19
Monumental architecture on the scale of the Hopewell earthworks is
generally assumed to imply a signiﬁcant agricultural surplus, governed by
chiefs or a stratum of religious leaders. Y et this isn’ t what was going on.
Rather we ﬁnd just the sort of ‘play farming’ familiar from our discussions
in Chapter Six , as well as shamans and engineers who spent the
overwhelming majority of their time with the same ﬁve or six companions,
but who periodically walked out on to the stage of an extended society that
encompassed much of the North American continent. It is all so strikingly
different from anything we know of later W oodlands societies that it’ s
difﬁcult to reconstruct exactly what these settlement patterns meant in
practice. If nothing else, however , this overall situation illustrates the
profound irrelevance of a conventional evolutionist terminology , based on a
progression from ‘bands’ to ‘tribes’ and ‘chiefdoms’.
So what kind of societies were these?
One thing we can deﬁnitely say is that they were artistically brilliant. For
all their modest living arrangements, Hopewellians produced one of the
most sophisticated repertories of imagery in the pre-Columbian Americas:
everything from efﬁgy pipes topped by exquisite animal carvings (used to
smoke a variety of tobacco strong enough to induce trance-like states, along
with other herbal concoctions); to ﬁred earthen jars covered in elaborate
designs; and small copper sheets, worn as breastplates, cut into intricate
geometrical designs. Much of the imagery is evocative of shamanic ritual,
vision quests and soul journeys (as we noted, there is a particular emphasis
on mirrors), but also periodic festivals of the dead.
Like Chavín de Huántar in the Andes, or indeed Poverty Point, social
inﬂuence derived from control over esoteric forms of knowledge. The main
difference is that the Hopewell Interaction Sphere has no discernible centre,
no single capital, and unlike Chavín it of fers little evidence for the existenceof permanent elites, priestly or otherwise. Analysis of burials reveals at
least a dozen dif ferent sets of insignia, ranging perhaps from funerary
priests to clan chief or diviner . Remarkably , it also appears to reveal the
existence of a developed clan system, since the ancient inhabitants of
central Ohio developed the historically unusual – but from an
archaeologist’ s point of view extraordinarily convenient – habit of including
bits of their totem animal – jaws, teeth, claws or talons, often fashioned into
pendants or jewellery – in their tombs. All the clans most familiar from
later North America – Deer , Wolf, Elk, Hawk, Snake and so on – were
already represented.20 The really striking thing is that, despite the existence
of a system of ofﬁces and clans, there appears to be virtually no relation
between the two. It is possible that clans sometimes ‘owned’ certain ofﬁces,
but there is little evidence for the existence of a hereditary , ranked elite.21
Some suggest that much of Hopewell ritual consisted of heroic-style
feasts and contests: races, games and gambling, which – if at all like later
Feasts of the Dead in the American Northeast – often ended by covering
great treasures beneath carefully layered strata of soil and gravel, so that
nobody (except, perhaps, gods or spirits) would ever see them again.22
Both the games and burials would, obviously , tend to militate against the
accumulation of wealth – or , better put, would ensure that social dif ferences
remained lar gely theatrical. Indeed, even those systemic dif ferences that can
be detected seem to be an ef fect of the ritual system, for the Hopewell
heartland appears to break down into a T ripartite Alliance, three great
clusters of sites.
In the northernmost, centred on Hopewell itself, funerary assemblages
focus on shamanic ritual, heroic male ﬁgures travelling between cosmic
domains. In the southern, best exempliﬁed by the T urner Site in southwest
Ohio, the emphasis is on an imagery of impersonal masked ﬁgures, hilltop
earth shrines and chthonic monsters. Still more remarkably , in the northern
cluster all those buried with badges of ofﬁce are men; in the southern, those
buried with the same badges of ofﬁce are just as exclusively women. (The
central cluster of sites is mixed, in both respects.)23 What’ s more, there was
clearly some kind of systemic co-ordination between the clusters, with
causeways joining them.24
It’s informative, at this point, to compare and contrast the Hopewell
Interaction Sphere with a phenomenon we discussed in the previouschapter: the ‘Ubaid village societies of Mesopotamia in the ﬁfth millennium
BC. The comparison might seem a stretch, but both can be conceived as
culture areas on the grandest possible scale, the ﬁrst in their respective
hemispheres to encompass the entire span of a great river system – the
Mississippi and the Euphrates respectively – from headwaters to delta,
including all the surrounding plains and coastlands.25 The establishment of
regular cultural interaction on such a scale, across sharply contrasting
landscapes and environmental niches, often marks an important turning
point in history . In the case of the ‘Ubaid it created a certain self-conscious
form of standardization, a social egalitarianism, that laid foundations for the
world’ s ﬁrst cities.26 What happened in the case of Hopewell seems rather
different.
In fact, in many ways Hopewell and ‘Ubaid are polar cultural opposites.
The unity of the ‘Ubaid interaction sphere lay in the suppression of
individual dif ferences between people and households; in contrast, the unity
of Hopewell lay in the celebration of dif ference. T o take one example:
while later North American societies would distinguish entire clans and
nations by characteristic hairstyles (so it was a simple matter to distinguish
a Seneca, Onondaga or Mohawk warrior at a distance), it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd
two ﬁgures in Hopewell art – and there are quite a few of them – that have
the same hair . Everybody appears to have been free to make a spectacle of
themselves, or to obtain some dramatic role in the theatre of society , and
this individual expressiveness was reﬂected in miniature depictions of
people sporting what seem to be an endless variety of playful, idiosyncratic
styles of haircut, clothing and ornamentation.27
Yet all this was intricately co-ordinated over lar ge areas. Even locally ,
each earthwork was one element in a continuous ritual landscape. The
earthworks’ alignments often reference particular segments of the Hopewell
calendar (such as the solstices, phases of the moon and so on), with people
presumably having to move back and forth regularly between the
monuments to complete a full ceremonial cycle. This is complex: one can
only imagine the kind of detailed knowledge of stars, rivers and seasons
that would have been required to co-ordinate people from hundreds of miles
away , such that they might congregate on time for rituals in centres that
lasted only for periods of ﬁve or six days at a time, over the course of a
year. Let alone what it would take to actually transform such a system
across the length and breadth of a continent.In later times, Feasts of the Dead were also occasions for the
‘resurrection’ of names, as the titles of those who were now gone passed to
the living. It may have been through some such mechanisms that Hopewell
disseminated the basic structure of its clan system across North America.
It’s even possible that when the spectacular burials in Hopewell came to an
end around AD 400, it was lar gely because Hopewell’ s work was done. The
idiosyncratic nature of its ritual art, for instance, gave way to standardized
versions disseminated across the continent; while great treks to fantastic,
temporary capitals that rose miraculously from the mud were no longer
required to establish ties between groups, who now had a shared idiom for
personal diplomacy , a common set of rules for interacting with strangers.28
IN WHICH WE TELL THE ST ORY OF CAHOKIA, WHICH
LOOKS LIKE IT OUGHT T O BE THE FIRST ‘ST ATE’ IN
AMERICA
One of the many puzzles of Hopewell is how its social arrangements seem
to anticipate much later institutions. There was a division between ‘white’
and ‘red’ clans: the ﬁrst identiﬁed with summer , circular houses and
peacemaking; the second with winter , square houses and warfare.29 Most
later indigenous societies had a separation between peace chiefs and war
chiefs: an entirely dif ferent administration came into force in times of
military conﬂict, then melted away as soon as matters were resolved. Some
of this symbolism appears to originate in Hopewell. Archaeologists even
identify certain ﬁgures as war chiefs; and yet, despite all this, there is an
almost total lack of evidence for actual warfare. One possibility is that
conﬂict took a dif ferent, more theatrical form – as in later times, when rival
nations or ‘enemy’ moieties would often play out their hostilities through
aggressive games of lacrosse.30
In the centuries following the decline of the Hopewell centres, roughly
from AD 400 to 800, we start to see a series of familiar developments. First,
some groups begin adopting maize as a staple crop and growing it in river
valleys along the Mississippi ﬂoodplain. Second, actual armed conﬂict
becomes more frequent. In at least some places, this led to populations
living for longer periods around their local earthworks. Especially in the
Mississippi valley and on adjacent bluf fs, a pattern emer ged of small towns
centred on earthen pyramids and plazas, some fortiﬁed, often surrounded byextensive stretches of no-man’ s-land. A few came to resemble tiny
kingdoms. Eventually this situation led to a veritable urban explosion with
its epicentre at the site of Cahokia, which was soon to become the greatest
city in the Americas north of Mexico.
Cahokia lies in an extensive ﬂoodplain along the Mississippi known as
the American Bottom. It was a bounteous and fertile environment, ideal for
growing maize, but still a challenging place to build a city since much of it
was swampland, foggy and full of shallow pools. Charles Dickens, who
once visited this place, described it as ‘an unbroken slough of black mud
and water ’. In Mississippian cosmology , watery places like this were
connected to the chaotic underworld – seen as the diametrical opposite of a
precise, predictable celestial order – and it’ s no doubt signiﬁcant that some
of the ﬁrst lar ge-scale construction at Cahokia centred on a processional
walkway known as the Rattlesnake Causeway , designed to rise from the
surrounding waters and leading towards the surrounding ridge-top tombs (a
Path of Souls, or W ay of the Dead). T o begin with, then, Cahokia was likely
a place of pilgrimage, much like some of the Hopewell sites.31
Its inhabitants also shared with Hopewell the same love of games.
Around AD 600, someone living at Cahokia or close by seems to have come
up with the idea for chunkey , later to become one of the most popular sports
in North America. Chunkey was a complex and highly co-ordinated af fair
in which running players tried to throw poles as close as possible to a
rolling wheel or ball without actually touching it.32 It was played at several
earthwork sites that sprang up along the American Bottom: one way of
holding together the increasingly disparate groups of people who came to
settle there. In social terms, it had certain things in common with
Mesoamerican ball games, though the rules were entirely dif ferent. It could
be either a substitute for , or continuation of, war; it was tied into legend (in
this case, the story of Red Horn the Morning Star who, much like the Maya
hero-twins, confronted gods of the underworld); and it could become the
focus of frenetic gambling, when some would even raise themselves or their
families as stakes.33
In Cahokia and its hinterland we can chart the rise of social hierarchies
through the lens of chunkey , as the game became increasingly monopolized
by an exclusive elite. One sign of this is how stone chunkey discs disappear
from ordinary burials, just as beautifully crafted versions of them start to
appear in the richest graves. Chunkey was becoming a spectator sport, andCahokia the sponsor of a new regional, Mississippian elite. W e are not sure
exactly how it happened – as an act of religious revelation, perhaps – but
around AD 1050 Cahokia exploded in size, growing from a fairly modest
community to a city of over six square miles, including more than 100
earthen mounds built around spacious plazas. Its original population of a
few thousand was augmented by perhaps 10,000 more, coming from
outside to settle in Cahokia and its satellite towns, totalling something in the
order of 40,000 in the American Bottom as a whole.34
The main part of the city was designed and built according to a master
plan in a single burst of activity . Its focus was a huge packed-earth pyramid
known today as Monk’ s Mound, standing before an enormous plaza. In a
smaller plaza to the west stood a ‘woodhenge’ of cypress posts marking out
the sun’ s annual course. Some of Cahokia’ s pyramids were topped with
palaces or temples; others with charnel houses or sweat lodges. A
calculated ef fort was made to resettle foreign populations – or at least their
most important, inﬂuential representatives – in newly designed thatch
houses, arranged in neighbourhoods around smaller plazas and earthen
pyramids; many had their own craft specializations or ethnic identity .35
From the summit of Monk’ s Mound the city’ s ruling elite enjoyed powers
of surveillance over these planned residential zones.36 At the same time,
existing villages and hamlets in Cahokia’ s hinterland were disbanded and
the rural population dispersed, scattered in homesteads of one or two
families.37
What’ s so striking about this pattern is its suggestion of an almost
complete dismantling of any self-governing communities outside the city .
For those who fell within its orbit, there was nothing much left between
domestic life – lived under constant surveillance from above – and the
awesome spectacle of the city itself.38 That spectacle could be terrifying.
Along with games and feasts, in the early decades of Cahokia’ s expansion
there were mass executions and burials, carried out in public. As with
ﬂedgling kingdoms in other parts of the world, these lar ge-scale killings
were directly associated with the funerary rites of nobility; in this case, a
mortuary facility centred on the paired burials of high-status males and
females,39 whose shrouded bodies were placed around a surface built up
from some thousands of shell beads. Around them an earthen mound was
formed, precisely oriented to an azimuth derived from the southernmost
rising point of the moon. Its contents included four mass graves holding thestacked bodies of mainly young women (though one was over ﬁfty), who
were killed speciﬁcally for the occasion.40
Carefully sifting through the ethnographic and historical evidence,
scholars have reconstructed the outlines of what Cahokia – and later
kingdoms modelled on it – must have looked like. While something
endured of the earlier clan or ganizations, the old moiety system was
transformed into an opposition between nobles and commoners. The
Mississippians appear to have been matrilineal, which meant that a mico
(ruler) was not succeeded by his children but by his eldest nephew . Nobles
could only marry commoners, and after several generations of such
intermarriage the descendants of kings might lose their noble status entirely .
So a pool of nobles-turned-commoners always existed from which warriors
and administrators could be drawn. Genealogies were carefully preserved,
and there was a priesthood devoted to maintaining the temples, which
contained images of royal ancestors. Lastly , there was a system of titles for
heroic achievement in war , which made it possible for commoners to win
their way into the nobility , a status symbolized in bird-man imagery , which
also invoked the prestige of competing at chunkey tournaments.41
Bird-man symbolism was especially marked in the smaller kingdoms –
some ﬁfty in all – that began to appear up and down the Mississippi, of
which the lar gest are at places called Etowah, Moundville and Spiro. The
rulers of these towns were often buried with what seem to be precious
badges and insignia manufactured at Cahokia. Sacred images in Cahokia
itself focused not so much on the hawk and falcon symbolism that appeared
everywhere else as – ﬁttingly for an increasingly prominent centre of
intensive grain production – on the ﬁgure of the Corn Mother , who also
appears as the Old W oman, a goddess holding a loom. During the eleventh
and twelfth centuries, Mississippian sites with links of various kinds to
Cahokia appear everywhere from V irginia to Minnesota, often in aggressive
conﬂict with their neighbours. T rade routes spanning the continent were
activated, the materials for new treasures pouring into the American Bottom
much as they once had to Hopewell.42
Very little of this expansion was directly controlled from the centre. W e
are unlikely to be talking about an actual empire so much as an intricate
ritual alliance, backed up ultimately by force – and things began to grow
increasingly violent, fairly fast. W ithin a century of the initial urban
explosion at Cahokia, in about AD 1150, a giant palisaded wall was built,though it only included some parts of the city and not others. This marked
the beginning of a long and uneven process of war , destruction and
depopulation. At ﬁrst people seem to have ﬂed the metropolis for the
hinterlands, then ultimately abandoned the rural bottomlands entirely .43
This same process can be observed in many of the smaller Mississippian
towns. Most appear to have begun as co-operative enterprises before
becoming centralized around the cult of some royal line and receiving
patronage from Cahokia. Then, over the course of a century or two, they
emptied out (in much the same way as the Natchez Great V illage was later
to do, and possibly for much the same reasons, as subjects sought freer lives
elsewhere) until ﬁnally being sacked, burned or simply deserted.
Whatever happened in Cahokia, it appears to have left extremely
unpleasant memories. Along with much of its bird-man mythology , the
place was erased from any later oral traditions. After AD 1400 the entire
fertile expanse of the American Bottom (which at the city’ s height had
contained perhaps as many as 40,000 people), along with the territory from
Cahokia up to the Ohio River , became what’ s referred to in the literature as
the V acant or Empty Quarter: a haunted wilderness of over grown pyramids
and housing blocks crumbling back into swamp, occasionally traversed by
hunters but devoid of permanent human settlement.44
Scholars continue to debate the relative importance of ecological and social
factors in Cahokia’ s collapse, just as they ar gue about whether or not it
should be considered a ‘complex chiefdom’ or a ‘state’.45 In our own terms
(as set out in the last chapter), what we appear to have in Cahokia is a
second-order regime in which two of our three elementary forms of
domination – in this case, control over violence and charismatic politics –
came together in a powerful, even explosive cocktail. This is the same
combination we found in the Classic Maya elite, for whom competitive
sports and warfare were similarly fused; and who extended their
sovereignty by bringing lar ge populations into their orbit through or ganized
spectacle, or by capture, or other forms of compulsion we can only guess at.
Both in Cahokia and the Classic Maya, managerial activities seem to
have focused on the administration of otherworldly matters, notably in the
sophistication of their ritual calendars and precise orchestration of sacred
space. These, however , had real-world ef fects, especially in the areas of
city-planning, labour mobilization, public surveillance and carefulmonitoring of the maize cycle.46 Perhaps we are dealing here with attempts
to create ‘third-order ’ regimes of domination, albeit of a very dif ferent kind
to modern nation states, in which control over violence and esoteric
knowledge became caught up in the spiralling political competition of rival
elites. This may also explain why , in both cases – Cahokia and the Maya –
the collapse of such totalizing (totalitarian, even) projects, when it
happened, was itself sudden, comprehensive and total.
Whatever the precise combination of factors at play , by about AD 1350 or
1400 the result was mass defection. Just as the metropolis of Cahokia was
founded through its rulers’ ability to bring diverse populations together ,
often from across long distances, in the end the descendants of those people
simply walked away . The V acant Quarter implies a self-conscious rejection
of everything the city of Cahokia stood for .47 How did it happen?
Among descendants of Cahokian subjects, migration is often framed as
implying the restructuring of an entire social order , mer ging our three
elementary freedoms into a single project of emancipation: to move away ,
to disobey and to build new social worlds. As we’ll see, the Osage – a
Siouan people who appear originally to have inhabited the region of Fort
Ancient in the Middle Ohio River valley before abandoning it for the Great
Plains – used the expression ‘moving to a new country’ as a synonym for
constitutional change.48 It is important to bear in mind that in this part of
North America, populations were relatively sparse. There were extensive
stretches of uninhabited territory (often marked by ruins and efﬁgies, their
builders long since for gotten), so it was not difﬁcult for groups simply to
relocate. What we would now call social movements often took the form of
quite literal physical movements.
To get a sense of the kind of ideological conﬂicts that must have been
going on, let’ s consider the history of the Etowah river valley , part of a
region then inhabited by ancestors of the Choctaw , in Geor gia and
Tennessee. Around the time of Cahokia’ s initial take-of f between AD 1000
and 1200, this area was emer ging from a period of generalized warfare.
Post-conﬂict settlement involved the creation of small towns, each with its
temple-pyramids and plaza, and in every case centred on a lar ge council
house, designed as a meeting place for the entire adult community . Grave
goods of the time show no indications of rank. Around 1200 the Etowah
valley was for some reason abandoned; then, around half a century later ,
people returned to it. A burst of construction ensued, including a palace andcharnel house on top of giant mounds – walled of f from commoner eyes –
and a royal tomb, placed directly atop the ruins of the communal council
house. Burials there were accompanied by magniﬁcent bird-man costumes
and regalia apparently sent from the workshops of Cahokia itself. Smaller
villages were broken up, some of their old residents moved into Etowah,
and in the countryside they were replaced by the familiar pattern of
scattered homesteads.49
Enclosed by a perimeter ditch and substantial palisade wall, the town of
Etowah was at this point clearly the capital of some sort of kingdom. In
1375 someone – whether external enemies or internal rebels, we do not
know – sacked Etowah and desecrated its holy places; then, after a brief and
abortive attempt at reoccupation, Etowah was again entirely abandoned, as
were all the towns across the region. During this period the priestly orders
seem lar gely to vanish across much of the Southeast, to be replaced by
warrior micos . Occasionally , these petty rulers would become paramount in
a given region, but they lacked either the ritual authority or economic
resources to create the kind of urban life that existed before. In about 1500
the Etowah valley fell under the sway of the kingdom of Coosa, by which
time most of the original population appears to have left and moved on,
leaving behind little more than a museum of earthworks for the Coosa to
lord it over .50
Some of those who walked away concentrated around the new capitals.
In 1540, a member of Hernando De Soto’ s expedition described the mico  of
Coosa and his core territory (a place now known, oddly enough, as Little
Egypt) in the following terms:
The cacique came out to welcome him in a carrying chair borne on
the shoulders of his principal men, seated on a cushion, and covered
with a robe of marten skins of the form and size of a woman’ s
shawl. He wore a crown of feathers on his head; and around him
were many Indians playing and singing. The land was very populous
and had many lar ge towns and planted ﬁelds which reached from
one town to the other . It was a charming and fertile land, with good
cultivated ﬁelds stretching along the rivers.51
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, petty kingdoms of this sort
appear to have been the dominant political form in much of the Southeast.Their rulers were treated with reverence and received tribute, but their rule
was brittle and unstable. The Coosa mico ’s litter , like that of his chief rival,
the Lady of Coﬁtachequi, was carried by subordinate lords, lar gely because
the latter couldn’ t be trusted not to rise up unless kept under constant
surveillance. Shortly after de Soto’ s departure several of them did just that,
causing the kingdom of Coosa to collapse. Meanwhile, outside the central
towns much more egalitarian forms of communal life were taking form.
ON HOW THE COLLAPSE OF THE MISSISSIPPIAN WORLD
AND REJECTION OF ITS LEGACY OPENED THE W AY TO NEW
FORMS OF INDIGENOUS POLITICS AROUND THE TIME OF
THE EUROPEAN INV ASION
By the early eighteenth century these petty kingdoms, and the very practice
of building mounds and pyramids, had almost entirely vanished from the
American South and Midwest. At the edge of the prairies, for example,
people living in scattered homesteads began migrating seasonally , leaving
the very young and old behind in the earthwork towns and taking to
extended hunting and ﬁshing in the surrounding uplands, before ﬁnally
relocating entirely . In other areas, the towns would be reduced to
ceremonial centres or Natchez-style hollow courts, where the mico
continued to be paid magniﬁcent tokens of respect but held almost no actual
power . Then ﬁnally , when those rulers were deﬁnitively gone, people would
begin descending back into the valleys, but this time in communities
organized on very dif ferent principles: small towns of a few hundred
people, or at most 1,000 or 2,000, with egalitarian clan structures and
communal council houses.
Today historians seem inclined to see these developments as in lar ge part
a reaction to the shock of war , slavery , conquest and disease introduced by
European settlers. However , they appear to have been the logical
culmination of processes that had been going on for centuries before that.52
By 1715, the year of the Y amasee W ar, the dismantling of petty
kingdoms was complete across the entire region of former Mississippian
inﬂuence, except for isolated hold-overs like the Natchez. Earthworks and
homesteads were both things of the past, and the Southeast came to be
divided among tribal republics, of the sort familiar from early
ethnography .53 A number of factors made this possible. The ﬁrst wasdemographic. As we’ve noted, North American societies were, with few
exceptions, marked by low birth rates and low population densities, which
in turn facilitated mobility and made it easier for agriculturalists to shift
back to a mode of subsistence more oriented to hunting, ﬁshing and
foraging; or simply to relocate entirely . Meanwhile women – who in one of
Scott’ s ‘grain states’ would typically be viewed by the (male) authorities as
little more than baby-making machines, and when not pregnant or nursing
to be engaged in industrial tasks like spinning and weaving – took on
stronger political roles.
Such details form part of the cultural background to a political struggle
over the role of hereditary leadership and privileged esoteric knowledge.
These battles were still being fought into relatively recent times. Consider
the Nations known in the colonial period as the ‘ﬁve civilized tribes’ of the
American Southeast: Cherokee, Chickasaw , Choctaw , Creek and Seminole.
All of them exemplify this pattern, being governed by communal councils
in which all had equal say and operating by a process of consensus-ﬁnding.
Yet at the same time, all shared traces of the older priests, castes and
princes. In some cases hereditary leadership may have persisted into the
nineteenth century , straining against the wider preference for more
democratic forms of government.54
Some see the egalitarian institutions themselves as an outcome of self-
conscious social movements, centred on the summer Green Corn
ceremonies.55 In art their symbol was the looped square; architecturally
this symbolic template was realized in the creation not just of council or
town houses, but also square grounds for public meetings, a feature with no
precedent in the old Mississippian towns and cities. Among the Cherokee
we ﬁnd evidence of priests claiming to be sent from the heavens with
special knowledge to impart. Y et we also ﬁnd stories, such as that of the
Aní-Kutánî, about the existence long ago of a theocratic society governed
by a hereditary caste of male priests and how they so systematically abused
their power , particularly in their abuse of women, that the people rose up
and massacred the lot of them.56
Much like the ar guments Iroquoian speakers presented to Jesuit
missionaries, or for that matter their theories about dreams, descriptions of
daily life in these post-Mississippian townships often feel strikingly familiar
– perhaps disturbingly so for anyone committed to the idea that the Age of
Enlightenment was the result of a ‘civilizing process’ originatingexclusively in Europe. Among the Creek, for instance, the post of mico  was
reduced to a facilitator of the assembly and supervisor of collective
granaries. Each day the adult men of a town would gather to spend much of
the day ar guing about politics, in a spirit of rational debate, in conversations
punctuated by the smoking of tobacco and drinking of caf feinated
beverages.57 Both tobacco and the ‘black drink’ had originally been drugs
ingested by shamans or other spiritual virtuosos in intense and highly
concentrated doses so as to produce altered states of consciousness; now ,
instead, they were doled out in carefully measured portions to everyone
assembled. What Jesuits reported in the Northeast seems to apply here too:
‘They believe that there is nothing so suitable as T obacco to appease the
passions; that is why they never attend a council without a pipe or calumet
in their mouths. The smoke, they say , gives them intelligence, and enables
them to see clearly through the most intricate matters.’58
Now , if all this sounds suspiciously reminiscent of an Enlightenment
coffee-house it isn’ t a total coincidence. T obacco, for example, was adopted
around this period by settlers then taken back and popularized in Europe
itself, and it was indeed promoted in Europe as a drug to be taken in small
doses to focus the mind. Obviously , there is no direct cultural translation
here. There never is. But as we have seen, indigenous North American ideas
– from the advocacy of individual liberties to scepticism of revealed
religion – certainly had an impact on the European Enlightenment, even
though, like pipe-smoking, such ideas underwent many transformations in
the process.59 No doubt it would be too much to suggest that the
Enlightenment itself had its ﬁrst stirrings in seventeenth-century North
America. But it’ s possible, perhaps, to imagine some future non-Eurocentric
history where such a suggestion would not be treated as almost by
deﬁnition outrageous and absurd.
HOW THE OSAGE CAME T O EMBODY THE PRINCIPLE OF
SELF-CONSTITUTION, LA TER T O BE CELEBRA TED IN
MONTESQUIEU’S
THE SPIRIT OF THE LA WS
Clearly , evolutionist categories only confuse the issue here. Ar guing about
whether Hopewellians were ‘bands’, ‘tribes’ or ‘chiefdoms’, or indeed
whether Cahokia was a ‘complex chiefdom’ or a ‘state’, tells us virtuallynothing. Insofar as we can speak of ‘states’ and ‘chiefdoms’ at all, in the
case of Native North America the state-making project seems to come ﬁrst,
virtually out of nowhere, and the chiefdoms observed by de Soto and his
successors appear to be little more than the rubble left behind by its
downfall.
There must be more interesting and useful questions to ask of the past,
and the categories we’ve been developing in this book suggest what some
of these might be. As we’ve seen, an important feature in much of the
Americas is the relationship between esoteric and bureaucratic knowledge.
On the surface, the two might not have much to do with one another . It is
easy enough to see how brute force can take institutional form in
sovereignty , or as the assertion of charisma in a competitive political ﬁeld.
The path from knowledge, as a general form of domination, to
administrative power might seem more circuitous. Does the kind of esoteric
knowledge we encounter at Chavín, often founded in hallucinogenic
experience, really have anything in common with the accounting methods
of the later Inca? It seems highly unlikely – until, that is, we recall that even
in much more recent times, qualiﬁcations to enter bureaucracies are
typically based on some form of knowledge that has virtually nothing to do
with actual administration. It’ s only important because it’ s obscure. Hence
in tenth-century China or eighteenth-century Germany , aspiring civil
servants had to pass exams on proﬁciency in literary classics, written in
archaic or even dead languages, just as today they will have had to pass
exams on rational choice theory or the philosophy of Jacques Derrida. The
arts of administration are really only learned later on and through more
traditional means: by practice, apprenticeship or informal mentoring.
Similarly , those who designed the great construction projects of Poverty
Point or Hopewell were clearly drawing on esoteric knowledge of some sort
– astronomical, mythic, numerological – which was contiguous with the
practical knowledge of maths, engineering and construction, not to mention
techniques of or ganizing and monitoring human labour (even voluntary
labour) which were required to realize those designs. Over the long term of
pre-Columbian history , this particular sort of knowledge always seems to lie
at the core of systems of domination that periodically emer ged. Hopewell is
a perfect example, since the heroic games that accompanied ceremonial
projects were not really the basis for systematic domination at all.60
Cahokia, on the other hand, appears to represent a self-conscious ef fort toturn that style of administrative esoterica into a basis for sovereignty; the
gradual transformation of geometric earthworks, designed on cosmic
principles, into actual fortiﬁcations being only the most obvious indication.
In the end it didn’ t work. Political power retreated back into heroic theatre,
if in a decidedly more violent form.
Even more strikingly , however , the very principle of esoteric knowledge
came increasingly to be challenged.
What we saw in Hopewell was a kind of ‘reformation’, in the same sense
that the European Reformation of the sixteenth century involved a
fundamental reorientation of access to the sacred – albeit one which had
knock-on ef fects in just about every other aspect of social life, from the
organization of work to the nature of politics. In Europe these battles played
out over the medium of scripture: the translation of the Bible from obscure
ancient languages into regional vernaculars, and its release from the closed
sanctuary of the High Faith into mass dissemination via the printing press.
In the pre-Columbian Americas, the equivalent media revolution focused
instead on the (quite literal) reformation of mathematical principles
underlying the creation of complex geometrical earthworks which captured
the sacred in spatial form.
In both cases, such reformations determined who could and could not
partake of a sacred power encapsulated in stories and myths, encoded on the
one hand as complex layers of scripture (the Old and New T estaments and
other holy books), and on the other as a network of landscape monuments,
just as complex in their own way . Indeed, there is every reason to think that
the images of chthonic and other beings frozen in ancient earthworks were
testaments of a sort. They were mnemonic schemes that prompted the
recollection and re-enactment of exploits carried out by founding ancestors
at the beginning of days and magniﬁed in monumental form, to be
witnessed by the powers dwelling ‘on high’. While European cler gy burned
incense to form a sentient bond with the invisible (a distant echo of biblical
animal sacriﬁce), Hopewell peoples lit tobacco in their efﬁgy pipes, sending
smoke up towards the heavens.
Here we begin to comprehend what it might have meant actually to stop
creating such monuments entirely , or to repurpose drugs like tobacco
towards collective, rational debate. Of course, this does not necessarily
imply a systematic, Enlightenment-style rejection of esoteric knowledge. Itcould also mean the democratization of such knowledge – or at least the
transformation of what had once been a theocratic elite into a kind of
oligarchy . We ﬁnd an excellent example of this in the history of the Osage.
A nation of the Great Plains, the Osage are directly descended from
Mississippianized Fort Ancient people, and much of their ritual and
mythology can be traced back directly to their Midwestern origins.61 The
Osage were doubly fortunate. First, because they succeeded in taking
advantage of a strategic position on the Missouri River to ally with the
French government and thereby maintain their independence, even creating
something of a trading empire from 1678 to 1803. Second, because the
ethnographer who documented their ancient traditions in the ﬁrst decades of
the twentieth century , Francis La Flesche, was himself a native speaker of
Omaha (a closely related language), and therefore appears to have been
unusually capable and receptive. As a result we have a much better sense of
how Osage elders thought about their own traditions than is the case for
most other Plains societies.
Let us begin with a map of a typical Osage summer village. Osage
communities typically moved between three seasonal locations: permanent
villages of multi-family lodge houses made up of perhaps 2,000 people;
summer camps; and camps for the annual midwinter bison hunts. The basic
village pattern was a circle divided into two exogamous moieties, sky and
earth, with twenty-four clans in all, each of which had to be represented in
any settlement or camp, just as at least one representative of each had to be
present for any major ritual. The system was initially based on a tripartite
division: seven clans each designated Sky People, Earth People and W ater
People, with the last two grouped together as the earth moiety in relation to
sky, making twenty-one; then over time this was expanded when clans were
added to become 7+2 (sky , Tsizhu ) against 7+7+1 (earth, Honga ), giving
twenty-four in total.
At this point you may well be wondering how , precisely , did it ever come
about that people arranged themselves in such intricate patterns? Who
exactly decided that each of the twenty-four clans would be represented in
every village, and how did they orchestrate things so it would happen? In
the case of the Osage we actually have something of an answer , since Osage
history was remembered essentially as a series of constitutional crises in
which the elders of the community gradually worked out exactly this
arrangement.The history , according to La Flesche, is difﬁcult to piece together because
it is distributed among the clans. Or , to be more exact, a bare-bones version
of the story , full of cryptic allusions, is known to everyone; but each clan
also has its own history and stock of secret knowledge, whereby the true
meaning of certain aspects of the story is revealed over the course of seven
levels of initiation. The real story then can be said to be broken into 168
pieces – ar guably 336, since each revelation contained two parts: a political
history and an accompanying philosophical reﬂection on what that history
reveals about the forces responsible for dynamic aspects of the visible
world that caused the stars to move, plants to grow , and so forth.Records, La Flesche observed, had also been kept of particular
discussions in which various results of this study of nature were debated
and discussed. Osage concluded that this force was ultimately unknowable
and gave it the name Wakonda , which could alternately be translated as
‘God’ or ‘Mystery’.62 Through lengthy investigation, La Flesche notes,
elders determined that life and motion was produced by the interaction of
two principles – sky and earth – and therefore they divided their own
society in the same way , arranging it so that men from one division could
only take wives from the other . A village was a model of the universe, and
as such a form of ‘supplication’ to its animating power .63
Initiation through the levels of understanding required a substantial
investment of time and wealth, and most Osage only attained the ﬁrst or
second tier . Those who reached the top were known collectively as the
Nohozhinga  or ‘Little Old Men’ (though some were women),64 and were
also the ultimate political authorities. While every Osage was expected to
spend an hour after sunrise in prayerful reﬂection, the Little-Old-Men
carried out daily deliberations on questions of natural philosophy and their
speciﬁc relevance to political issues of the day . They also kept a history of
the most important discussions.65 La Flesche explains that, periodically ,
particularly perplexing questions would come up: either about the nature of
the visible universe, or about the application of these understandings to
human af fairs. At this point it was customary for two elders to retreat to a
secluded spot in the wilderness and carry out a vigil for four to seven days,
to ‘search their minds’, before returning with a report on their conclusions.
The Nohozhinga  were the body that met daily to discuss af fairs of
state.66 While lar ger assemblies could be called to ratify decisions, they
were the ef fective government. In this sense one could say that the Osage
were a theocracy , though it would be more accurate, perhaps, to say there
was no dif ference between ofﬁcials, priests and philosophers. All were title-
bearing ofﬁcials, including the ‘soldiers’ assigned to help chiefs enforce
their decisions, while ‘Protectors of the Land’ assigned to hunt down and
kill outsiders who poached game were also religious ﬁgures. As for the
history: it begins in mythic terms, as an ‘allegorical fable’, then rapidly
turns into a story about institutional reform.
In the beginning, the three main divisions – Sky People, Earth People and
Water People – descended into the world and set out in search of its
indigenous inhabitants. When they located these inhabitants, they werediscovered to be in a repulsive state: living amid ﬁlth, bones and carrion,
feeding on of fal, rotting ﬂesh, even each other . Despite this more-than-
Hobbesian situation, the Isolated Earth People (as they came to be known)
were also powerful sorcerers, capable of using the four winds to destroy life
everywhere. Only the chief of the W ater division had the courage to enter
their village, negotiate with their leader and convince his people to abandon
their murderous and unsanitary ways. In the end, he persuaded the Isolated
Earth People to join them in a federation – to ‘move to a new country’, free
from the pollution of decaying corpses. This is how the circular village plan
was ﬁrst conceived, with the one-time wizards placed opposite W ater, at the
eastern door , where they were in char ge of the House of Mystery , used for
all peaceful rituals, and where all children were brought to be named. The
Bear clan of the Earth division was put in char ge of an opposite House of
Mystery , responsible for rituals concerning war . The problem was that the
Isolated Earth People, while no longer murderous, did not prove
particularly ef fective allies either . Before long everything had descended
into continual strife and feuding, until the W ater division demanded another
‘move to a new country’, which initiated, among other things, an elaborate
process of constitutional reform, making declarations of war impossible
without the acquiescence of every clan. This too proved problematic over
time, since it meant that if an external enemy entered the country , at least a
week was required to or ganize a military response. Eventually it became
necessary yet again to ‘move to another country’, which this time involved
the creation of a new , decentralized clan-by-clan system of military
authority . This in turn led to a new crisis and round of reforms: in this case,
the separation of civil and military af fairs with the creation of a hereditary
peace chief for each division, their houses placed on the east and west
extremes of the village, and various subordinate ofﬁcials, as well as a
parallel structure with responsibility for all ﬁve major Osage villages.
We will not linger over the details. But two elements of the story deserve
emphasis. The ﬁrst is that the narrative sets of f from the neutralization of
arbitrary power: the taming of the Isolated Earth People’ s leader – the chief
sorcerer , who abuses his deadly knowledge – by according him some
central position in a new system of alliances. This is a common story
among the descendants of groups that had formerly come under the
inﬂuence of Mississippian civilization. In the process of co-opting their
leader , the destructive ritual knowledge once held by the Isolated EarthPeople was, eventually , distributed to everyone, along with elaborate checks
and balances concerning its use. The second is that even the Osage, who
ascribed key roles to sacred knowledge in their political af fairs, in no sense
saw their social structure as something given from on high but rather as a
series of legal and intellectual discoveries – even breakthroughs.
This last point is critical, because – as outlined earlier – we are used to
imagining that the very notion of a people self-consciously creating their
own institutional arrangements is lar gely a product of the Enlightenment.
Obviously , the idea that nations could be ef fectively created by great
lawmakers such as Solon of Athens, L ycurgus in Sparta or Zoroaster in
Persia, and that their national character was in some sense a product of that
institutional structure, was a familiar one in antiquity . But we are generally
taught to think of the French political philosopher Charles-Louis de
Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu as the ﬁrst to build an explicit and
systematic body of theory based on the principle of institutional reform with
his book The Spirit of the Laws  (1748). By doing so, it’ s widely believed, he
effectively created modern politics. The Founding Fathers of the United
States, all avid readers of Montesquieu, were consciously trying to put his
theories into practice when they attempted to create a constitution that
would preserve the spirit of individual liberty , and spoke of the results as a
‘government of laws and not of men’.
As it turns out, precisely this sort of thinking was commonplace in North
America well before European settlers appeared on the scene. It might not
be a coincidence, in fact, that in 1725 a French explorer named Bour gmont
brought an Osage and Missouria delegation across the Atlantic to Paris,
around the time Lahontan’ s works were at the height of their popularity . It
was traditional at the time to or ganize a series of public events around such
‘savage’ diplomats and arrange private meetings with prominent European
intellectuals. W e don’ t know whom speciﬁcally they met with, but
Montesquieu was indeed in Paris at the time, and already working on such
subjects. As one historian of the Osage notes, it is hard to imagine
Montesquieu would not have attended. At any rate, the chapters in The
Spirit of the Laws  which speculate on the modes of savage government
seem an almost exact reproduction of what Montesquieu would likely have
heard from them, albeit framed by an artiﬁcial distinction between those
who do or don’ t cultivate the land.67
The connections may well run deeper than we think.IN WHICH WE RETURN T O IROQUOIA, AND CONSIDER THE
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHIES LIKEL Y TO HA VE BEEN F AMILIAR
TO KANDIARONK IN HIS YOUTH
We have come full circle. The case of North America not only throws
conventional evolutionary schemes into chaos; it also clearly demonstrates
that it’ s simply not true to say that if one falls into the trap of ‘state
formation’ there’ s no getting out. Whatever happened in Cahokia, the
backlash against it was so severe that it set forth repercussions we are still
feeling today .
What we are suggesting is that indigenous doctrines of individual liberty ,
mutual aid and political equality , which made such an impression on French
Enlightenment thinkers, were neither (as many of them supposed) the way
all humans can be expected to behave in a State of Nature. Nor were they
(as many anthropologists now assume) simply the way the cultural cookie
happened to crumble in that particular part of the world. This is not to say
there is no truth whatsoever in either of these positions. As we’ve said
before, there are certain freedoms – to move, to disobey , to rearrange social
ties – that tend to be taken for granted by anyone who has not been
speciﬁcally trained into obedience (as anyone reading this book, for
instance, is likely to have been). Still, the societies that European settlers
encountered, and the ideals expressed by thinkers like Kandiaronk, only
really make sense as the product of a speciﬁc political history: a history in
which questions of hereditary power , revealed religion, personal freedom
and the independence of women were still very much matters of self-
conscious debate, and in which the overall direction, for the last three
centuries at least, had been explicitly anti-authoritarian.
East St Louis is, of course, a long way from Montreal, and no one to our
knowledge has ever suggested that Iroquoian-speaking peoples of the Great
Lakes region were ever , themselves, directly under Mississippian rule. So it
would be going a bit too far to suggest that the views recorded by men like
Lahontan were, in any literal sense, the ideology that overthrew
Mississippian civilization. Still, a careful review of oral traditions, historical
accounts and the ethnographic record shows that those who framed what we
call the ‘indigenous critique’ of European civilization were not only keenly
aware of alternative political possibilities, but for the most part saw their
own social orders as self-conscious creations, designed as a barrier againstall that Cahokia might have represented – or indeed, all those qualities they
were later to ﬁnd so objectionable in the French.
Let us start with the available oral traditions. These are unfortunately
somewhat limited. During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries,
Iroquoia was divided between a number of shifting political coalitions and
confederacies of which the most prominent were the W endat (Huron), based
in what’ s now Quebec; the Five Nations or Haudenosaunee (often referred
to as ‘League Iroquois’), distributed across what’ s now upstate New Y ork;
and an Ontario-based confederation that the French referred to as the
‘Neutrals’. The W endat referred to this last as Attiwandaronk – which
literally means ‘those whose speech is not quite right’. W e don’ t actually
know what these Neutrals called themselves (clearly it wasn’ t that); but
according to early accounts, they were by far the most numerous and
powerful, at least until their society was devastated by famine and disease
in the 1630s and 1640s. Afterwards the survivors were absorbed by the
Seneca, given names and thus incorporated in one or other Seneca clan.
A similar fate befell the W endat Confederation, whose power had been
decisively broken in the year Kandiaronk was born, 1649, when they were
scattered or absorbed during the notorious ‘Beaver W ars’. In Kandiaronk’ s
own lifetime the remaining W endat were leading a fairly precarious
existence: partly driven north towards Quebec; partly under the protection
of a French fort in a place called Michilimackinac, near Lake Michigan.
Kandiaronk himself spent much of his life trying to put the confederation’ s
pieces back together and, according to oral histories at least, attempting to
found a coalition that would unite the warring nations against the invaders.
In this he failed. As a result, we don’ t actually know the stories told by
members of any of these other great confederacies about the origins of their
political institutions. By the time oral histories began to be written down in
the nineteenth century , only the Haudenosaunee remained.
We do, however , have numerous versions of the foundation of the League
of Five Nations (the Seneca, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Mohawk), an
epic known as the Gayanashagowa . What is most remarkable about this
epic, in the present context at least, is the degree to which it represents
political institutions as self-conscious human creations. Certainly , the story
contains magical elements. In a certain sense, the main characters –
Deganawideh the Peacemaker , Jigonsaseh the Mother of Nations and soforth – are reincarnations of characters from the creation myth. But what
comes through most strongly in the text is its representation of a social
problem with a social solution: a breakdown of relationships in which the
country is plunged into chaos and revenge, spiralling to a point where social
order has dissolved away and where the powerful have become literal
cannibals. Most powerful of all is Adodarhoh (T adodaho), who is
represented as a witch, deformed, monstrous and capable of commanding
others to do his bidding.
The narrative centres on a hero, Deganawideh the Peacemaker , who
appears from what is later to be the Attiwandaronk (Neutral) territory to the
northwest, determined to put an end to this chaotic state of af fairs. He wins
to his cause ﬁrst the Jigonsaseh, a woman famous for standing outside all
quarrels (he ﬁnds her hosting and feeding war parties from all sides of the
conﬂict); and then Hiawatha, one of Adodarhoh’ s cannibal henchmen.
Together they set about winning over the people of each nation to agree on
creating a formal structure for heading of f disputes and creating peace.
Hence the system of titles, nested councils, consensus-ﬁnding, condolence
rituals and the prominent role of female elders in formulating policy . In the
story , the very last to be won over is Adodarhoh himself, who is gradually
healed of his deformities and turned into a human being. In the end the laws
of the League are ‘spoken into’ belts of wampum , which serves as its
constitution; the records are transferred to the keeping of Adodarhoh; and,
his work ﬁnished, the Peacemaker vanishes from the earth.
Since Haudenosaunee names are passed on like titles, there has continued
to be an Adodarhoh, just as there is also still a Jigonsaseh and Hiawatha, to
this day . Forty-nine sachems, delegated to convey the decisions of their
nation’ s councils, continue to meet regularly . These meetings always begin
with a rite of ‘condolence’, in which they wipe away the grief and rage
caused by the memory of anyone who died in the interim, to clear their
minds to go about the business of establishing peace (the ﬁftieth, the
Peacemaker himself, is always represented by an empty place). This federal
system was the peak of a complex apparatus of subordinate councils, male
and female, all with carefully designated powers – but none with actual
powers of compulsion.
In its essence, the story is not so dif ferent from the founding of the Osage
social order: a terrifying witch is brought back into society , and in the
process transformed into a peacemaker . The main dif ference is that, in thiscase, Adodarhoh is quite explicitly a ruler , one invested with power of
command:
South of the Onondaga town lived an evil-minded man. His lodge
was in a swale and his nest was made of bulrushes. His body was
distorted by seven crooks and his long tangled locks were adorned
by withering living serpents. Moreover , this monster was a devourer
of raw meat, even of human ﬂesh. He was also a master of wizardry
and by his magic he destroyed men but he could not be destroyed.
Adodarhoh was the name of the evil man.
Notwithstanding the evil character of Adodarhoh the people of
Onondaga, the Nation of Many Hills, obeyed his commands and
though it cost many lives they satisﬁed his insane whims, so much
did they fear him and his sorcery .68
It is an anthropological commonplace that if you want to get a sense of a
society’ s ultimate values it is best to look at what they consider to be the
worst sort of behaviour; and that the best way to get a sense of what they
consider to be the worst possible behaviour is by examining ideas about
witches. For the Haudenosaunee, the giving of orders is represented as
being almost as serious an outrage as the eating of human ﬂesh.69
Representing Adodarhoh as a king might seem surprising, since there
seems no reason to think that, before the arrival of Europeans, either the
Five Nations or any of their immediate neighbours had any immediate
experience of arbitrary command. This raises precisely the question often
directed against ar guments70 that indigenous institutions of chiefship were
in fact designed to prevent any danger of states emer ging: how could so
many societies be or ganizing their entire political system around heading
off something (i.e. ‘the state’) that they had never experienced? The
straightforward response is that most of the narratives were gathered in the
nineteenth century , by which time any indigenous American was likely to
have had long and bitter experience of the United States government: men
in uniforms carrying legal briefs, issuing arbitrary commands and much
more besides. So perhaps this element was added to these narratives later?
Anything is possible, of course, but this strikes us as unlikely .71
Even in more recent times, the danger of being accused of witchcraft was
deployed against ofﬁce holders to ensure that none could accumulate anyappreciable advantage over their fellows – particularly in wealth. Here we
have to return to the Iroquoian theory about dreams as repressed desires,
mentioned earlier in the chapter . One interesting twist of this theory is that
it was considered the responsibility of others to realize a fellow community
member ’s dream: even if one dreamed of appropriating a neighbour ’s
possession, it could only be refused at the risk of endangering their health.
To do so was considered beyond awkward; almost socially impossible.
Even if one did it would cause outraged gossip, and very possibly bloody
revenge: if somebody was thought to have died because somebody else
refused to grant a soul wish, his or her relatives might retaliate physically ,
or by supernatural means.72
Any member of an Iroquoian society given an order would have ﬁercely
resisted it as a threat to their personal autonomy – but the one exception to
this norm was, precisely , dreams.73 One Huron-W endat chief gave away
his prized European cat, which he had carried by canoe all the way from
Quebec, to a woman who dreamed she could only be cured by owning it
(Iroquoians also feared becoming the victims of witchcraft practised
consciously or unconsciously by people who envied them). Dreams were
treated as if they were commands, delivered either by one’ s own soul or
possibly , in the case of a particularly vivid or portentous dream, by some
greater spirit. The spirit might be the Creator or some other spirit, perhaps
entirely unknown. Dreamers could become prophets – if only , usually , for a
relatively brief period of time.74 During that time, however , their orders
had to be obeyed. (Needless to say , there were few more terrible crimes
than to falsify a dream.)
In other words, the image of the witch was at the centre of a complex of
ideas that had everything to do with unconscious desire, including the
unconscious desire to dominate, and the need both to realize it and to keep
it under control.
How did all this come about, historically?
The exact time and circumstance of the League of Five Nations’ creation
is unclear; dates have been proposed ranging from AD 1142 to sometime
around 1650.75 No doubt the creation of such confederacies was an
ongoing process; and surely , like almost all historical epics, the
Gayanashagowa  patches together elements, many historically accurate,
others less so, drawn from dif ferent periods of time. What we know fromthe archaeological record is that Iroquoian society as it existed in the
seventeenth century began to take form around the same time as the heyday
of Cahokia.
By around AD 1100 maize was being cultivated in Ontario, in what later
became Attiwandaronk (Neutral) territory . Over the next several centuries,
the ‘three sisters’ (corn, beans and squash) became ever more important in
local diets – though Iroquoians were careful to balance the new crops with
older traditions of hunting, ﬁshing and foraging. The key period seems to be
what’ s called the Late Owasco phase, from AD 1230 to 1375, when people
began to move away from their previous settlements (and from their earlier
patterns of seasonal mobility) along waterways, settling in palisaded towns
occupied all year around in which longhouses, presumably based in
matrilineal clans, became the predominant form of dwelling. Many of these
towns were quite substantial, containing as many as 2,000 inhabitants (that
is, something approaching a quarter of the population of central Cahokia).76
References to cannibalism in the Gayanashagowa  epic are not pure
fantasy: endemic warfare and the torture and ceremonial sacriﬁce of war
prisoners are sporadically documented from AD 1050. Some contemporary
Haudenosaunee scholars think the myth refers to an actual conﬂict between
political ideologies within Iroquoian societies at the time; turning especially
on the importance of women, and agriculture, against defenders of an older
male-dominated order where prestige was entirely based in war and
hunting.77 (If so, it would not look so very dif ferent from the kind of
ideological diver gence we’ve suggested might have been taking place in the
Middle East during the early phases of the Neolithic.)78 Some kind of
compromise between these two positions appears to have been reached
around the eleventh century AD, one result of which was a stabilizing of
population at a modest level. Population numbers increased fairly quickly
for two or three centuries after the widespread adoption of maize, squash
and beans, but by the ﬁfteenth century they had levelled of f. The Jesuits
later reported how Iroquoian women were careful to space their births,
setting optimal population to the ﬁsh and game capacities of the region, not
its potential agricultural productivity . In this way the cultural emphasis on
male hunting actually reinforced the power and autonomy of Iroquoian
women, who maintained their own councils and ofﬁcials and whose power
in local af fairs at least was clearly greater than that of their men.79In the period spanning the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, neither the
Wendat Confederacy nor Haudenosaunee show much evidence of having
extensive contact or even much trade with the Mississippians, whose main
presence in the Northeast was in the Fort Ancient region along the Ohio
River and the nearby Monongahela valley . This is not true, however , of the
Attiwandaronk. By AD 1300, much of the Ontario area was indeed under
Mississippian inﬂuence. It is doubtful, but not totally inconceivable, that
there were migrations from the Cahokian heartland.80 Even if there
weren’ t, the Attiwandaronk appear to have been monopolizing trade to the
south and through it to the Chesapeake Bay and beyond, leaving the W endat
and Haudenosaunee to form relations with Algonkian peoples to their north
and east. The sixteenth century saw a sharp increase in Mississippian
inﬂuences in Ontario, including various cult objects and ceremonial regalia,
and even lar ge numbers of chunkey stones of the same style that also appear
at Fort Ancient.
Archaeologists refer to all this as ‘Mississippianization’, and it is
accompanied by strong evidence for a renewed burst of trade at least as far
as Delaware culminating in, among other things, the arrival of enormous
quantities of shells and shell beads derived from the mid-Atlantic seaboard
from around 1610 onwards, to be piled up in Attiwandaronk tombs. By that
time, the Attiwandaronk population was several times lar ger than any of the
neighbouring confederations, W endat, Haudenosaunee, let alone the Erie,
Petun, W enro or other small rivals; and its capital, Ounotisaston, was then
among the lar gest settlements in the Northeast. (Scholars, predictably , argue
about whether the Neutrals could thus qualify as a ‘simple chiefdom’ rather
than a mere ‘tribe’.)
Certainly , the Jesuits who visited the region before Attiwandaronk
society was, ef fectively , destroyed by plagues and famines were unanimous
in insisting that its constitution was fundamentally dif ferent from that of its
neighbours. W e will probably never have the means to reconstruct precisely
how. For instance, the French referred to the Attiwandaronk as ‘the Neutral
Nation’ lar gely because they took no part in the near -constant conﬂicts
between the various nations making up the W endat and Haudenosaunee, but
instead allowed war parties from both sides free passage through their
territories. This echoes the behaviour attributed to the Jigonsaseh, Mother
of Nations, the highest-ranking woman ofﬁcial among the later
Haudenosaunee, in their national epic, who was indeed said to have been ofAttiwandaronk origin. But at the same time the Attiwandaronk were in no
sense neutral in their relations with many of their western and southern
neighbours.
Indeed, according to the Recollect Father Joseph de la Roche Daillon, in
1627 the Attiwandaronk were dominated by a warlord named T souharissen,
‘the chief of the greatest credit and authority that has ever been in all these
nations, because he is not only chief of his town, but of all those of his
nation … It is unexampled in the other nations to have a chief so absolute.
He acquired this honour and power by his courage, and by having been
many times at war against seventeen nations who are their enemies.’81
When he was away at war , in fact, the federal council (in all other Iroquoian
societies the ultimate authority) could make no important decisions.
Tsouharissen seems to have been something at least very like a king.
What was the relation of T souharissen and the Jigonsaseh, a ﬁgure who
came to exemplify principles of reconciliation that are in many ways
precisely the opposite of kingship and self-aggrandizement? W e don’ t
know . The only source we have for details of T souharissen’ s life is very
much contested, an oral history purporting to be the testimony of
Tsouharissen’ s third wife, passed down three centuries to the present day .82
Almost all historians discount it – but that isn’ t necessarily an absolute
disqualiﬁcation. At any rate, according to the account T souharissen was a
child prodigy , a brilliant student of esoteric knowledge. The story of his
existence reached a certain Cherokee priest, who travelled to become his
tutor; he found a great crystal which he said marked him as a reincarnation
of the Sun and fought many wars and married four times. But when he
decided to hand on his mantle to the daughter of his youngest T uscarora
wife, a similar child prodigy , disaster struck. So infuriated by this plan was
his senior (Attiwandaronk) wife, of the highest-ranking T urtle clan, that she
ambushed and killed the daughter , whose mother took her own life in
despair . Tsouharissen, in a rage, massacred the culprit’ s entire lineage,
including his own heirs, thus ef fectively destroying any possibility of
dynastic succession.
As we say , we have no idea how much credit to give the story: but we do
know that its broad outlines reﬂect realities. Attiwandaronk at that time did
indeed have regular connections with nations as far away as the Cherokee;
while the problems of how to square esoteric knowledge with democratic
institutions, or even the difﬁculties faced by powerful men trying toestablish dynasties when descent was or ganized according to matrilineal
clans with no internal ranking, would have been familiar issues in North
America at that time. T souharissen deﬁnitely existed, and he did apparently
try to translate his success as a warrior into centralized power . We also
know it ultimately came to nothing. W e just don’ t know if it really came to
nothing in this particular way .
By the time Baron de Lahontan was serving with the French army in
Canada, and Kandiaronk was holding forth on questions of political theory
at his periodic dinners with Governor Frontenac, the Attiwandaronk no
longer existed. Still, the events surrounding T souharissen’ s life were likely
to have been familiar to Kandiaronk, as they would have been vivid
childhood memories for many of the elders known to him in his formative
years. The Jigonsaseh, Mother of Nations, for instance, was still very much
alive, the last Attiwandaronk holder of the title having been incorporated in
the W olf clan of the Seneca in 1650. She remained established in her
traditional seat, a fortress called Kienuka overlooking the Niagara gor ge.83
Either that Jigonsaseh – or , more likely , her successor – was still there in
1687, when Louis XIV decided to put an end to the ongoing threat the Five
Nations posed to French settlement by sending a seasoned military
commander , the Marquis de Denonville, as governor , with orders to use
whatever force necessary to drive the Nations from what is now upstate
New Y ork.
We have a report on what happened from Lahontan’ s own memoirs.
Feigning interest in a peace settlement, Denonville invited the League
council, as a body , to negotiate terms in a place called Fort Frontenac (after
the former governor). Some 200 delegates arrived, including all the
permanent ofﬁcers of the confederation and many from the women’ s
councils as well. Summarily arresting them, Denonville shipped them of f to
France to serve as galley slaves. Then, taking advantage of the resulting
confusion, he ordered his men to invade the Five Nations’ territory .
(Lahontan, who strongly disapproved of the proceedings, got himself into
trouble for trying to intervene and stop some underlings from casually
torturing the prisoners – he was ordered away , but in the end spared further
sanction after protesting that he had been drunk. Some years later , in a
different context, an order was put out for his arrest on grounds of
insubordination, and he had to ﬂee to Amsterdam.)84The Jigonsaseh, however , had chosen not to attend Denonville’ s meeting.
The arrest of the entire Grand Council left her the highest-ranking League
ofﬁcial. Since in such an emer gency there was no time to raise new chiefs,
she and the remaining clan mothers themselves raised an army . Many of
those recruited, it is reported, were themselves Seneca women. As it turned
out, the Jigonsaseh was a far superior military tactician to Denonville. After
routing the invading French troops near V ictor, New Y ork, her forces were
at the point of entering Montreal when the French government sued for
peace, agreeing to dismantle Fort Niagara and return the surviving galley
slaves.85 When Lahontan later notes that, like Kandiaronk, ‘those who had
been galley slaves in France’ were highly critical of French institutions, he
is referring lar gely to those taken prisoner on this occasion – or more
speciﬁcally the dozen or so, out of the original 200, who made it back alive.
In such a lethal context, why draw attention to the depredations of a self-
appointed lord such as T souharissen? What his example demonstrates, we
suggest, is that even within indigenous society , the political question was
never deﬁnitively settled. Certainly , the overall direction, in the wake of
Cahokia, was a broad movement away from overlords of any sort and
towards constitutional structures carefully worked out to distribute power in
such a way that they would never return. But the possibility that they might
always lurked in the background. Other paradigms of governance existed,
and ambitious men – or women – could, if occasion allowed, appeal to
them. After her defeat of Denonville the Jigonsaseh appears to have
demobilized her army and returned to the process of selecting new ofﬁcials
to reconstitute the Great Council. If she had chosen to act otherwise,
however , precedents were available.
It was precisely this combination of such conﬂicting ideological
possibilities – and, of course, the Iroquoian penchant for prolonged political
argument – that lay behind what we have called the indigenous critique of
European society . It would be impossible to understand the origins of its
particular emphasis on individual liberty , for instance, outside that context.
Those ideas about liberty had a profound impact on the world. In other
words, not only did indigenous North Americans manage almost entirely to
sidestep the evolutionary trap that we assume must always lead, eventually ,
from agriculture to the rise of some all-powerful state or empire; but in
doing so they developed political sensibilities that were ultimately to have adeep inﬂuence on Enlightenment thinkers and, through them, are still with
us today .
In this sense, at least, the W endat won the ar gument. It would be
impossible for a European today , or anyone, really – whatever they actually
thought – to take a position like that of the seventeenth-century Jesuits and
simply declare themselves opposed to the very principle of human freedom.1 2
Conclusion
The dawn of everything
This book began with an appeal to ask better questions. W e started out by
observing that to inquire after the origins of inequality necessarily means
creating a myth, a fall from grace, a technological transposition of the ﬁrst
chapters of the Book of Genesis – which, in most contemporary versions,
takes the form of a mythical narrative stripped of any prospect of
redemption. In these accounts, the best we humans can hope for is some
modest tinkering with our inherently squalid condition – and hopefully ,
dramatic action to prevent any looming, absolute disaster . The only other
theory on of fer to date has been to assume that there were no origins of
inequality , because humans are naturally somewhat thuggish creatures and
our beginnings were a miserable, violent af fair; in which case ‘progress’ or
‘civilization’ – driven forward, lar gely, by our own selﬁsh and competitive
nature – was itself redemptive. This view is extremely popular among
billionaires but holds little appeal to anyone else, including scientists, who
are keenly aware that it isn’ t in accord with the facts.
It’s hardly surprising, perhaps, that most people feel a spontaneous
afﬁnity with the tragic version of the story , and not just because of its
scriptural roots. The more rosy , optimistic narrative – whereby the progress
of W estern civilization inevitably makes everyone happier , wealthier and
more secure – has at least one obvious disadvantage. It fails to explain why
that civilization did not simply spread of its own accord; that is, why
European powers should have been obliged to spend the last 500 or so years
aiming guns at people’ s heads in order to force them to adopt it. (Also, if
being in a ‘savage’ state was so inherently miserable, why so many of those
same W esterners, given an informed choice, were so eager to defect to it at
the earliest opportunity .) During the nineteenth-century heyday of Europeanimperialism, everyone seemed more keenly aware of this. While we
remember that age as one of naive faith in ‘the inevitable march of
progress’, liberal, T urgot-style progress was actually never really the
dominant narrative in V ictorian social theory , let alone political thought.
In fact, European statesmen and intellectuals of that time were just as
likely to be obsessed with the dangers of decadence and disintegration.
Many were overt racists who held that most humans are not capable of
progress, and therefore looked forward to their physical extermination.
Even those who did not share such views tended to feel that Enlightenment
schemes for improving the human condition had been catastrophically
naive. Social theory , as we know it today , emer ged lar gely from the ranks of
such reactionary thinkers, who – looking back over their shoulders at the
turbulent consequences of the French Revolution – were less concerned
with disasters being visited on peoples overseas than on growing misery
and public unrest at home. As a result, the social sciences were conceived
and or ganized around two core questions: (1) what had gone wrong with the
project of Enlightenment, with the unity of scientiﬁc and moral progress,
and with schemes for the improvement of human society? And: (2) why is it
that well-meaning attempts to ﬁx society’ s problems so often end up
making things even worse?
Why , these conservative thinkers asked, did it prove so difﬁcult for
Enlightenment revolutionaries to put their ideas into practice? Why couldn’ t
we just imagine a more rational social order and then legislate it into
existence? Why did the passion for liberty , equality and fraternity end up
producing the T error? There must surely be some underlying reasons.
If nothing else, these preoccupations help to explain the continued
relevance of an otherwise not particularly successful eighteenth-century
Swiss musician named Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Those primarily concerned
with the ﬁrst question saw him as the ﬁrst to ask it in a quintessentially
modern way . Those mainly concerned with the second were able to
represent him as the ultimate clueless villain, a simple-minded
revolutionary who felt that the established order , being irrational, could
simply be brushed aside. Many held Rousseau personally responsible for
the guillotine. By contrast, few nowadays read the ‘traditionalists’ of the
nineteenth century , but they’re actually important since it is they , not the
Enlightenment philosophes , who are really responsible for modern social
theory . It’s long been recognized that almost all the great issues of modernsocial science – tradition, solidarity , authority , status, alienation, the sacred
– were ﬁrst raised in the works of men like the theocratic V icomte de
Bonald, the monarchist Comte de Maistre, or the Whig politician and
philosopher Edmund Burke as examples of the kind of stubborn social
realities which they felt that Enlightenment thinkers, and Rousseau in
particular , had refused to take seriously , with (they insisted) disastrous
results.
These nineteenth-century debates between radicals and reactionaries
never really ended; they keep resurfacing in dif ferent forms. Nowadays, for
instance, those on the right are more likely to see themselves as defenders
of Enlightenment values, and those on the left its most ardent critics. But
over the course of the ar gument all parties have come to agree on one key
point: that there was indeed something called ‘the Enlightenment’, that it
marked a fundamental break in human history , and that the American and
French Revolutions were in some sense the result of this rupture. The
Enlightenment is seen as introducing a possibility that had simply not
existed before: that of self-conscious projects for reshaping society in
accord with some rational ideal. That is, of genuine revolutionary politics.
Obviously , insurrections and visionary movements had existed before the
eighteenth century . No one could deny that. But such pre-Enlightenment
social movements could now lar gely be dismissed as so many examples of
people insisting on a return to certain ‘ancient ways’ (that they had often
just made up), or else claiming to act on a vision from God (or the local
equivalent).
Pre-Enlightenment societies, or so this ar gument goes, were ‘traditional’
societies, founded on community , status, authority and the sacred. They
were societies in which human beings did not ultimately act for themselves,
individually or collectively . Rather , they were slaves of custom; or , at best,
agents of inexorable social forces which they projected on to the cosmos in
the form of gods, ancestors or other supernatural powers. Supposedly , only
modern, post-Enlightenment people had the capacity to self-consciously
intervene in history and change its course; on this everyone suddenly
seemed to agree, no matter how virulently they might disagree about
whether it was a good idea to do so.
All this might seem a bit of a caricature, and only a minority of authors
were willing to state matters quite so bluntly . Yet most modern thinkers
have clearly found it bizarre to attribute self-conscious social projects orhistorical designs to people of earlier epochs. Generally , such ‘non-modern’
folk were considered too simple-minded (not having achieved ‘social
complexity’); or to be living in a kind of mystical dreamworld; or , at best,
were thought to be simply adapting themselves to their environment at an
appropriate level of technology . Anthropology , it must be confessed, did not
play a stellar role here.
For much of the twentieth century , anthropologists tended to describe the
societies they studied in ahistorical terms, as living in a kind of eternal
present. Some of this was an ef fect of the colonial situation under which
much ethnographic research was carried out. The British Empire, for
instance, maintained a system of indirect rule in various parts of Africa,
India and the Middle East where local institutions like royal courts, earth
shrines, associations of clan elders, men’ s houses and the like were
maintained in place, indeed ﬁxed by legislation. Major political change –
forming a political party , say, or leading a prophetic movement – was in
turn entirely illegal, and anyone who tried to do such things was likely to be
put in prison. This obviously made it easier to describe the people
anthropologists studied as having a way of life that was timeless and
unchanging.
Since historical events are by deﬁnition unpredictable, it seemed more
scientiﬁc to study those phenomena one could in fact predict: the things that
kept happening, over and over , in roughly the same way . In a Senegalese or
Burmese village this might mean describing the daily round, seasonal
cycles, rites of passage, patterns of dynastic succession, or the growing and
splitting of villages, always emphasizing how the same structure ultimately
endured. Anthropologists wrote this way because they considered
themselves scientists (‘structural-functionalists’, in the jar gon of the day).
In doing so they made it much easier for those reading their descriptions to
imagine that the people being studied were quite the opposite of scientists:
that they were trapped in a mythological universe where nothing changed
and very little really happened. When Mircea Eliade, the great Romanian
historian of religion, proposed that ‘traditional’ societies lived in ‘cyclical
time’, innocent of history , he was simply drawing the obvious conclusion.
As a matter of fact, he went even further .
In traditional societies, according to Eliade, everything important has
already happened. All the great founding gestures go back to mythic times,
the illo tempor e,1 the dawn of everything, when animals could talk or turninto humans, sky and earth were not yet separated, and it was possible to
create genuinely new things (marriage, or cooking, or war). People living in
this mental world, he felt, saw their own actions as simply repeating the
creative gestures of gods and ancestors in less powerful ways, or as
invoking primordial powers through ritual. According to Eliade, historical
events thus tended to mer ge into archetypes. If anyone in what he
considered a traditional society does do something remarkable – establishes
or destroys a city , creates a unique piece of music – the deed will eventually
end up being attributed to some mythic ﬁgure anyway . The alternative
notion, that history is actually going somewhere (the Last Days, Judgment,
Redemption), is what Eliade referred to as ‘linear time’, in which historical
events take on signiﬁcance in relation to the future, not just the past.
And this ‘linear ’ sense of time, Eliade insisted, was a relatively recent
innovation in human thought, one with catastrophic social and
psychological consequences. In his view , embracing the notion that events
unfold in cumulative sequences, as opposed to recapitulating some deeper
pattern, rendered us less able to weather the vicissitudes of war , injustice
and misfortune, plunging us instead into an age of unprecedented anxiety
and, ultimately , nihilism. The political implications of this position were, to
say the least, unsettling. Eliade himself had been close to the fascist Iron
Guard in his student days, and his basic ar gument was that the ‘terror of
history’ (as he sometimes called it) was introduced by Judaism and the Old
Testament – which he saw as paving the way for the further disasters of
Enlightenment thought. Being Jewish, the authors of the present book don’ t
particularly appreciate the suggestion that we are somehow to blame for
everything that went wrong in history . Still, for present purposes, what’ s
startling is that anyone ever took this sort of ar gument seriously .
Imagine we tried applying Eliade’ s distinction between ‘historical’ and
‘traditional’ societies to the full scope of the human past, on the sort of
scale we’ve been covering in the preceding chapters. W ould this not have to
mean that most of history’ s great discoveries – for example the ﬁrst
weaving of fabrics, or the ﬁrst navigations of the Paciﬁc Ocean, or the
invention of metallur gy – were made by people who didn’ t believe in
discovery or in history? This seems unlikely . The only alternative would be
to argue that most human societies only became ‘traditional’ more recently:
perhaps they each eventually found a state of equilibrium, settled into it and
all came up with a shared ideological framework to justify their newfoundcondition. Which would mean there actually was some kind of previous illo
tempor e or time of creation, when all humans were capable of thinking and
acting in the kind of highly creative ways we now consider quintessentially
modern; one of their major achievements apparently being to ﬁnd a way of
abolishing most future prospects of innovation.
Both positions are, self-evidently , quite absurd.
Why are we entertaining such ideas? Why does it seem so odd, even
counter -intuitive, to imagine people of the remote past as making their own
history (even if not under conditions of their own choosing)? Part of the
answer no doubt lies in how we have come to deﬁne science itself, and
social science in particular .
Social science has been lar gely a study of the ways in which human
beings are not free: the way that our actions and understandings might be
said to be determined by forces outside our control. Any account which
appears to show human beings collectively shaping their own destiny , or
even expressing freedom for its own sake, will likely be written of f as
illusory , awaiting ‘real’ scientiﬁc explanation; or if none is forthcoming
(why do people dance?), as outside the scope of social theory entirely . This
is one reason why most ‘big histories’ place such a strong focus on
technology . Dividing up the human past according to the primary material
from which tools and weapons were made (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron
Age) or else describing it as a series of revolutionary breakthroughs
(Agricultural Revolution, Urban Revolution, Industrial Revolution), they
then assume that the technologies themselves lar gely determine the shape
that human societies will take for centuries to come – or at least until the
next abrupt and unexpected breakthrough comes along to change everything
again.
Now , we are hardly about to deny that technologies play an important
role in shaping society . Obviously , technologies are important: each new
invention opens up social possibilities that had not existed before. At the
same time, it’ s very easy to overstate the importance of new technologies in
setting the overall direction of social change. T o take an obvious example,
the fact that T eotihuacanos or Tlaxcalteca employed stone tools to build and
maintain their cities, while the inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro or Knossos
used metal, seems to have made surprisingly little dif ference to those cities’
internal or ganization or even size. Nor does our evidence support the notionthat major innovations always occur in sudden, revolutionary bursts,
transforming everything in their wake. (This, as you’ll recall, was one of the
main points to emer ge from the two chapters we devoted to the origins of
farming.)
Nobody , of course, claims that the beginnings of agriculture were
anything quite like, say , the invention of the steam-powered loom or the
electric light bulb. W e can be fairly certain there was no Neolithic
equivalent of Edmund Cartwright or Thomas Edison, who came up with the
conceptual breakthrough that set everything in motion. Still, it often seems
difﬁcult for contemporary writers to resist the idea that some sort of
similarly dramatic break with the past must have occurred. In fact, as we’ve
seen, what actually took place was nothing like that. Instead of some male
genius realizing his solitary vision, innovation in Neolithic societies was
based on a collective body of knowledge accumulated over centuries,
largely by women, in an endless series of apparently humble but in fact
enormously signiﬁcant discoveries. Many of those Neolithic discoveries
had the cumulative ef fect of reshaping everyday life every bit as profoundly
as the automatic loom or lightbulb.
Every time we sit down to breakfast, we are likely to be beneﬁting from a
dozen such prehistoric inventions. Who was the ﬁrst person to ﬁgure out
that you could make bread rise by the addition of those microor ganisms we
call yeasts? W e have no idea, but we can be almost certain she was a
woman and would most likely not be considered ‘white’ if she tried to
immigrate to a European country today; and we deﬁnitely know her
achievement continues to enrich the lives of billions of people. What we
also know is that such discoveries were, again, based on centuries of
accumulated knowledge and experimentation – recall how the basic
principles of agriculture were known long before anyone applied them
systematically – and that the results of such experiments were often
preserved and transmitted through ritual, games and forms of play (or even
more, perhaps, at the point where ritual, games and play shade into each
other).
‘Gardens of Adonis’ are a ﬁtting symbol here. Knowledge about the
nutritious properties and growth cycles of what would later become staple
crops, feeding vast populations – wheat, rice, corn – was initially
maintained through ritual play farming of exactly this sort. Nor was this
pattern of discovery limited to crops. Ceramics were ﬁrst invented, longbefore the Neolithic, to make ﬁgurines, miniature models of animals and
other subjects, and only later cooking and storage vessels. Mining is ﬁrst
attested as a way of obtaining minerals to be used as pigments, with the
extraction of metals for industrial use coming only much later .
Mesoamerican societies never employed wheeled transport; but we know
they were familiar with spokes, wheels and axles since they made toy
versions of them for children. Greek scientists famously came up with the
principle of the steam engine, but only employed it to make temple doors
that appeared to open of their own accord, or similar theatrical illusions.
Chinese scientists, equally famously , ﬁrst employed gunpowder for
ﬁreworks.
For most of history , then, the zone of ritual play constituted both a
scientiﬁc laboratory and, for any given society , a repertory of knowledge
and techniques which might or might not be applied to pragmatic problems.
Recall, for example, the ‘Little Old Men’ of the Osage and how they
combined research and speculation on the principles of nature with the
management and periodic reform of their constitutional order; how they
saw these as ultimately the same project and kept careful (oral) records of
their deliberations. Did the Neolithic town of Çatalhöyük or the T ripolye
mega-sites host similar colleges of ‘Little Old W omen’? W e cannot know
for certain, but it strikes us as quite likely , given the shared rhythms of
social and technical innovation that we observe in each case and the
attention to female themes in their art and ritual. If we are trying to frame
more interesting questions to ask of history , this might be one: is there a
positive correlation between what is usually called ‘gender equality’ (which
might better be termed, simply , ‘women’ s freedom’) and the degree of
innovation in a given society?
Choosing to describe history the other way round, as a series of abrupt
technological revolutions, each followed by long periods when we were
prisoners of our own creations, has consequences. Ultimately it is a way of
representing our species as decidedly less thoughtful, less creative, less free
than we actually turn out to have been. It means not describing history as a
continual series of new ideas and innovations, technical or otherwise,
during which dif ferent communities made collective decisions about which
technologies they saw ﬁt to apply to everyday purposes, and which to keep
conﬁned to the domain of experimentation or ritual play . What is true of
technological creativity is, of course, even more true of social creativity .One of the most striking patterns we discovered while researching this book
– indeed, one of the patterns that felt most like a genuine breakthrough to us
– was how , time and again in human history , that zone of ritual play has
also acted as a site of social experimentation – even, in some ways, as an
encyclopaedia of social possibilities.
We are not the ﬁrst to suggest this. In the mid twentieth century , a British
anthropologist named A. M. Hocart proposed that monarchy and
institutions of government were originally derived from rituals designed to
channel powers of life from the cosmos into human society . He even
suggested at one point that ‘the ﬁrst kings must have been dead kings’,2
and that individuals so honoured only really became sacred rulers at their
funerals. Hocart was considered an oddball by his fellow anthropologists
and never managed to secure a permanent job at a major university . Many
accused him of being unscientiﬁc, just engaging in idle speculation.
Ironically , as we’ve seen, it is the results of contemporary archaeological
science that now oblige us to start taking his speculations seriously . To the
astonishment of many , but much as Hocart predicted, the Upper Palaeolithic
really has produced evidence of grand burials, carefully staged for
individuals who indeed seem to have attracted spectacular riches and
honours, lar gely in death.
The principle doesn’ t just apply to monarchy or aristocracy , but to other
institutions as well. W e have made the case that private property ﬁrst
appears as a concept in sacred contexts, as do police functions and powers
of command, along with (in later times) a whole panoply of formal
democratic procedures, like election and sortition, which were eventually
deployed to limit such powers.
Here is where things get complicated. T o say that, for most of human
history , the ritual year served as a kind of compendium of social
possibilities (as it did in the European Middle Ages, for instance, when
hierarchical pageants alternated with rambunctious carnivals), doesn’ t really
do the matter justice. This is because festivals are already seen as
extraordinary , somewhat unreal, or at the very least as departures from the
everyday order . Whereas, in fact, the evidence we have from Palaeolithic
times onwards suggests that many – perhaps even most – people did not
merely imagine or enact dif ferent social orders at dif ferent times of year ,
but actually lived in them for extended periods of time. The contrast with
our present situation could not be more stark. Nowadays, most of us ﬁnd itincreasingly difﬁcult even to picture what an alternative economic or social
order would be like. Our distant ancestors seem, by contrast, to have moved
regularly back and forth between them.
If something did go terribly wrong in human history – and given the
current state of the world, it’ s hard to deny something did – then perhaps it
began to go wrong precisely when people started losing that freedom to
imagine and enact other forms of social existence, to such a degree that
some now feel this particular type of freedom hardly even existed, or was
barely exercised, for the greater part of human history . Even those few
anthropologists, such as Pierre Clastres and later Christopher Boehm, who
argue that humans were always able to imagine alternative social
possibilities, conclude – rather oddly – that for roughly 95 per cent of our
species’ history those same humans recoiled in horror from all possible
social worlds but one: the small-scale society of equals. Our only dreams
were nightmares: terrible visions of hierarchy , domination and the state. In
fact, as we’ve seen, this is clearly not the case.
The example of Eastern W oodlands societies in North America, explored
in our last chapter , suggests a more useful way to frame the problem. W e
might ask why , for example, it proved possible for their ancestors to turn
their backs on the legacy of Cahokia, with its overweening lords and
priests, and to reor ganize themselves into free republics; yet when their
French interlocutors ef fectively tried to follow suit and rid themselves of
their own ancient hierarchies, the result seemed so disastrous. No doubt
there are quite a number of reasons. But for us, the key point to remember is
that we are not talking here about ‘freedom’ as an abstract ideal or formal
principle (as in ‘Liberty , Equality and Fraternity!’).3 Over the course of
these chapters we have instead talked about basic forms of social liberty
which one might actually put into practice: (1) the freedom to move away
or relocate from one’ s surroundings; (2) the freedom to ignore or disobey
commands issued by others; and (3) the freedom to shape entirely new
social realities, or shift back and forth between dif ferent ones.
What we can now see is that the ﬁrst two freedoms – to relocate, and to
disobey commands – often acted as a kind of scaf folding for the third, more
creative one. Let us clarify some of the ways in which this ‘propping-up’ of
the third freedom actually worked. As long as the ﬁrst two freedoms were
taken for granted, as they were in many North American societies when
Europeans ﬁrst encountered them, the only kings that could exist werealways, in the last resort, play kings. If they overstepped the line, their
erstwhile subjects could always ignore them or move someplace else. The
same would go for any other hierarchy of ofﬁces or system of authority .
Similarly , a police force that operated for only three months of the year , and
whose membership rotated annually , was in a certain sense a play police
force – which makes it slightly less bizarre that their members were
sometimes recruited directly from the ranks of ritual clowns.4
It’s clear that something about human societies really has changed here,
and quite profoundly . The three basic freedoms have gradually receded, to
the point where a majority of people living today can barely comprehend
what it might be like to live in a social order based on them.
How did it happen? How did we get stuck? And just how stuck are we
really?
‘There is no way out of the imagined order ,’ writes Y uval Noah Harari in
his book Sapiens . ‘When we break down our prison walls and run towards
freedom’, he goes on, ‘we are in fact running into the more spacious
exercise yard of a bigger prison.’5 As we saw in our ﬁrst chapter , he is not
alone in reaching this conclusion. Most people who write history on a grand
scale seem to have decided that, as a species, we are well and truly stuck
and there is really no escape from the institutional cages we’ve made for
ourselves. Harari, once again echoing Rousseau, seems to have captured the
prevailing mood.
We’ll come back to this point, but for now we want to think a bit further
about this ﬁrst question: how did it happen? T o some degree this must
remain a matter for speculation. Asking the right questions may eventually
sharpen our understanding, but for now the material at our disposal,
especially for the early phases of the process, is still too sparse and
ambiguous to provide deﬁnitive answers. The most we can of fer are some
preliminary suggestions, or points of departure, based on the ar guments
presented in this book; and perhaps we can also begin to see more clearly
where others since the time of Rousseau have been going wrong.
One important factor would seem to be the gradual division of human
societies into what are sometimes referred to as ‘culture areas’; that is, the
process by which neighbouring groups began deﬁning themselves against
each other and, typically , exaggerating their dif ferences. Identity came to be
seen as a value in itself, setting in motion processes of culturalschismogenesis. As we saw in the case of Californian foragers and their
aristocratic neighbours on the Northwest Coast, such acts of cultural refusal
could also be self-conscious acts of political contestation, marking the
boundary (in this case) between societies where inter -group warfare,
competitive feasting and household bondage were rejected – as in those
parts of Aboriginal California closest to the Northwest Coast – and where
they were accepted, even celebrated, as quintessential features of social life.
Archaeologists, taking a longer view , see a proliferation of such regional
culture areas, especially from the end of the last Ice Age on, but are often at
a loss to explain why they emer ged or what constitutes a boundary between
them.
Still, this appears to have been an epochal development. Recall, for
example, how post-Ice Age hunter -gatherers, especially in coastal or
woodland regions, were enjoying something of a Golden Age. There appear
to have been all sorts of local experiments, reﬂected in a proliferation of
opulent burials and monumental architecture, the social functions of which
often remain enigmatic: from shell-built ‘amphitheatres’ along the Gulf of
Mexico to the great storehouses of Sannai Maruyama in Jōmon Japan, or
the so-called ‘Giants’ Churches’ of the Bothnian Sea. It is among such
Mesolithic populations that we often ﬁnd not just the multiplication of
distinct culture areas, but also the ﬁrst clear archaeological indications of
communities divided into permanent ranks, sometimes accompanied by
interpersonal violence, even warfare. In some cases this may already have
meant the stratiﬁcation of households into aristocrats, commoners and
slaves. In others, quite dif ferent forms of hierarchy may have taken root.
Some appear to have become, ef fectively , ﬁxed in place.
The role of warfare warrants further discussion here, because violence is
often the route by which forms of play take on more permanent features.
For example, the kingdoms of the Natchez or Shilluk might have been
largely theatrical af fairs, their rulers unable to issue orders that would be
obeyed even a mile or two away; but if someone was arbitrarily killed as
part of a theatrical display , that person remained deﬁnitively dead even after
the performance was over . It’s an almost absurdly obvious point to make,
but it matters. Play kings cease to be play kings precisely when they start
killing people; which perhaps also helps to explain the excesses of ritually
sanctioned violence that so often ensued during transitions from one state to
the other . The same is true of warfare. As Elaine Scarry points out, twocommunities might choose to resolve a dispute by partaking in a contest,
and often they do; but the ultimate dif ference between war (or ‘contests of
injuring’, as she puts it) and most other kinds of contest is that anyone
killed or disﬁgured in a war remains so, even after the contest ends.6
Still, we must be cautious. While human beings have always been
capable of physically attacking one another (and it’ s difﬁcult to ﬁnd
examples of societies where no one ever attacks anyone else, under any
circumstances), there’ s no actual reason to assume that war has always
existed. T echnically , war refers not just to or ganized violence but to a kind
of contest between two clearly demarcated sides. As Raymond Kelly has
adroitly pointed out, it’ s based on a logical principle that’ s by no means
natural or self-evident, which states that major violence involves two teams,
and any member of one team treats all members of the other as equal
targets. Kelly calls this the principle of ‘social substitutability’7 – that is, if
a Hatﬁeld kills a McCoy and the McCoys retaliate, it doesn’ t have to be
against the actual murderer; any Hatﬁeld is fair game. In the same way , if
there is a war between France and Germany , any French soldier can kill any
German soldier , and vice versa. The murder of entire populations is simply
taking this same logic one step further . There is nothing particularly
primordial about such arrangements; certainly , there is no reason to believe
they are in any sense hardwired into the human psyche. On the contrary , it’s
almost invariably necessary to employ some combination of ritual, drugs
and psychological techniques to convince people, even adolescent males, to
kill and injure each other in such systematic yet indiscriminate ways.
It would seem that for most of human history , no one saw much reason to
do such things; or if they did, it was rare. Systematic studies of the
Palaeolithic record of fer little evidence of warfare in this speciﬁc sense.8
Moreover , since war was always something of a game, it’ s not entirely
surprising that it has manifested itself in sometimes more theatrical and
sometimes more deadly variations. Ethnography provides plenty of
examples of what could best be described as play war: either with non-
deadly weapons or , more often, battles involving thousands on each side
where the number of casualties after a day’ s ‘ﬁghting’ amount to perhaps
two or three. Even in Homeric-style warfare, most participants were
basically there as an audience while individual heroes taunted, jeered and
occasionally threw javelins or shot arrows at one another , or engaged in
duels. At the other extreme, as we’ve seen, there is an increasing amount ofarchaeological evidence for outright massacres, such as those that took
place among Neolithic village dwellers in central Europe after the end of
the last Ice Age.
What strikes us is just how uneven such evidence is. Periods of intense
inter-group violence alternate with periods of peace, often lasting centuries,
in which there is little or no evidence for destructive conﬂict of any kind.
War did not become a constant of human life after the adoption of farming;
indeed, long periods of time exist in which it appears to have been
successfully abolished. Y et it had a stubborn tendency to reappear , if only
many generations later . At this point another new question comes into
focus. W as there a relationship between external warfare and the internal
loss of freedoms that opened the way , ﬁrst to systems of ranking and then
later on to lar ge-scale systems of domination, like those we discussed in the
later chapters of this book: the ﬁrst dynastic kingdoms and empires, such as
those of the Maya, Shang or Inca? And if so, how direct was this
correlation? One thing we’ve learned is that it’ s a mistake to begin
answering such questions by assuming that these ancient polities were
simply archaic versions of our modern states.
The state, as we know it today , results from a distinct combination of
elements – sovereignty , bureaucracy and a competitive political ﬁeld –
which have entirely separate origins. In our thought experiment of two
chapters ago, we showed how those elements map directly on to basic
forms of social power which can operate at any scale of human interaction,
from the family or household all the way up to the Roman Empire or the
super -kingdom of T awantinsuyu. Sovereignty , bureaucracy and politics are
magniﬁcations of elementary types of domination, grounded respectively in
the use of violence, knowledge and charisma. Ancient political systems –
especially those, such as the Olmec or Chavín de Huántar , that elude
deﬁnition in terms of ‘chiefdoms’ and ‘states’ – can often be understood
better in terms of how they developed one axis of social power to an
extraordinary degree (e.g. charismatic political contests and spectacles in
the Olmec case, or control of esoteric knowledge in Chavín). These are
what we termed ‘ﬁrst-order regimes’.
Where two axes of power were developed and formalized into a single
system of domination we can begin to talk of ‘second-order regimes’. The
architects of Egypt’ s Old Kingdom, for example, armed the principle of
sovereignty with a bureaucracy and managed to extend it across a lar geterritory . By contrast, the rulers of ancient Mesopotamian city-states made
no direct claims to sovereignty , which for them resided properly in heaven.
When they engaged in wars over land or irrigation systems, it was only as
secondary agents of the gods. Instead they combined charismatic
competition with a highly developed administrative order . The Classic
Maya were dif ferent again, conﬁning administrative activities lar gely to the
monitoring of cosmic af fairs, while basing their earthly power on a potent
fusion of sovereignty and inter -dynastic politics.
Insofar as these and other polities commonly regarded as ‘early states’
(Shang China, for instance) really share any common features, they seem to
lie in altogether dif ferent areas – which brings us back to the question of
warfare, and the loss of freedoms within society . All of them deployed
spectacular violence at the pinnacle of the system (whether that violence
was conceived as a direct extension of royal sovereignty or carried out at
the behest of divinities); and all to some degree modelled their centres of
power – the court or palace – on the or ganization of patriarchal households.
Is this merely a coincidence? On reﬂection, the same combination of
features can be found in most later kingdoms or empires, such as the Han,
Aztec or Roman. In each case there was a close connection between the
patriarchal household and military might. But why exactly should this be
the case?
The question has proved difﬁcult to answer in all but superﬁcial terms,
partly because our own intellectual traditions oblige us to use what is, in
effect, imperial language to do so; and the language already implies an
explanation, even a justiﬁcation, for much of what we are really trying to
account for here. That is why , in the course of this book, we sometimes felt
the need to develop our own, more neutral (dare we say scientiﬁc?) list of
baseline human freedoms and forms of domination; because existing
debates almost invariably begin with terms derived from Roman Law , and
for a number of reasons this is problematic.
The Roman Law conception of natural freedom is essentially based on
the power of the individual (by implication, a male head of household) to
dispose of his property as he sees ﬁt. In Roman Law property isn’ t even
exactly a right, since rights are negotiated with others and involve mutual
obligations; it’ s simply power – the blunt reality that someone in possession
of a thing can do anything he wants with it, except that which is limited ‘by
force or law’. This formulation has some peculiarities that jurists havestruggled with ever since, as it implies freedom is essentially a state of
primordial exception to the legal order . It also implies that property is not a
set of understandings between people over who gets to use or look after
things, but rather a relation between a person and an object characterized by
absolute power . What does it mean to say one has the natural right to do
anything one wants with a hand grenade, say , except those things one isn’ t
allowed to do? Who would come up with such an odd formulation?
An answer is suggested by the W est Indian sociologist Orlando Patterson,
who points out that Roman Law conceptions of property (and hence of
freedom) essentially trace back to slave law .9 The reason it is possible to
imagine property as a relationship of domination between a person and a
thing is because, in Roman Law , the power of the master rendered the slave
a thing ( res, meaning an object), not a person with social rights or legal
obligations to anyone else. Property law , in turn, was lar gely about the
complicated situations that might arise as a result. It is important to recall,
for a moment, who these Roman jurists actually were that laid down the
basis for our current legal order – our theories of justice, the language of
contract and torts, the distinction of public and private and so forth. While
they spent their public lives making sober judgments as magistrates, they
lived their private lives in households where they not only had near -total
authority over their wives, children and other dependants, but also had all
their needs taken care of by dozens, perhaps hundreds of slaves.
Slaves trimmed their hair , carried their towels, fed their pets, repaired
their sandals, played music at their dinner parties and instructed their
children in history and maths. At the same time, in terms of legal theory
these slaves were classiﬁed as captive foreigners who, conquered in battle,
had forfeited rights of any kind. As a result, the Roman jurist was free to
rape, torture, mutilate or kill any of them at any time and in any way he had
a mind to, without the matter being considered anything other than a private
affair. (Only under the reign of T iberius were any restrictions imposed on
what a master could do to a slave, and what this meant was simply that
permission from a local magistrate had to be obtained before a slave could
be ripped apart by wild animals; other forms of execution could still be
imposed at the owner ’s whim.) On the one hand, freedom and liberty were
private af fairs; on the other , private life was marked by the absolute power
of the patriarch over conquered people who were considered his private
property .10The fact that most Roman slaves were not prisoners of war , in the literal
sense, doesn’ t really make much dif ference here. What’ s important is that
their legal status was deﬁned in those terms. What is both striking and
revealing, for our present purposes, is how in Roman jurisprudence the
logic of war – which dictates that enemies are interchangeable, and if they
surrendered they could either be killed or rendered ‘socially dead’, sold as
commodities – and, therefore, the potential for arbitrary violence was
inserted into the most intimate sphere of social relations, including the
relations of care that made domestic life possible. Thinking back to
examples like the ‘capturing societies’ of Amazonia or the process by
which dynastic power took root in ancient Egypt, we can begin to see how
important that particular nexus of violence and care has been. Rome took
the entanglement to new extremes, and its legacy still shapes our basic
concepts of social structure.
Our very word ‘family’ shares a root with the Latin famulus , meaning
‘house slave’, via familia , which originally referred to everyone under the
domestic authority of a single paterfamilias  or male head of household.
Domus , the Latin word for ‘household’, in turn gives us not only ‘domestic’
and ‘domesticated’ but dominium , which was the technical term for the
emperor ’s sovereignty as well as a citizen’ s power over private property .
Through that we arrive at (literally , ‘familiar ’) notions of what it means to
be ‘dominant’, to possess ‘dominion’ and to ‘dominate’. Let us follow this
line of thought a little further .
We’ve seen how , in various parts of the world, direct evidence of warfare
and massacres – including the carrying-of f of captives – can be detected
long before the appearance of kingdoms or empires. Much harder to
ascertain, for such early periods of history , is what happened to captive
enemies: were they killed, incorporated or left suspended somewhere in
between? As we learned from various Amerindian cases, things may not
always be entirely clear -cut. There were often multiple possibilities. It’ s
instructive, in this context, to return one last time to the case of the W endat
in the age of Kandiaronk, since this was one society that seemed determined
to avoid ambiguity in such matters.
In certain ways W endat, and Iroquoian societies in general around that
time, were extraordinarily warlike. There appear to have been bloody
rivalries fought out in many northern parts of the Eastern W oodlands even
before European settlers began supplying indigenous factions with muskets,resulting in the ‘Beaver W ars’. The early Jesuits were often appalled by
what they saw , but they also noted that the ostensible reasons for wars were
entirely dif ferent from those they were used to. All W endat wars were, in
fact, ‘mourning wars’, carried out to assuage the grief felt by close relatives
of someone who had been killed. T ypically , a war party would strike against
traditional enemies, bringing back a few scalps and a small number of
prisoners. Captive women and children would be adopted. The fate of men
was lar gely up to the mourners, particularly the women, and appeared to
outsiders at least to be entirely arbitrary . If the mourners felt it appropriate a
male captive might be given a name, even the name of the original victim.
The captive enemy would henceforth become that other person and, after a
few years’ trial period, be treated as a full member of society . If for any
reason that did not happen, however , he suf fered a very dif ferent fate. For a
male warrior taken prisoner , the only alternative to full adoption into
Wendat society was excruciating death by torture.
Jesuits found the details shocking and fascinating. What they observed,
sometimes at ﬁrst hand, was a slow , public and highly theatrical use of
violence. T rue, they conceded, the W endat torture of captives was no more
cruel than the kind directed against enemies of the state back home in
France. What seems to have really appalled them, however , was not so
much the whipping, boiling, branding, cutting-up – even in some cases
cooking and eating – of the enemy , so much as the fact that almost everyone
in a W endat village or town took part, even women and children. The
suffering might go on for days, with the victim periodically resuscitated
only to endure further ordeals, and it was very much a communal af fair.1 1
The violence seems all the more extraordinary once we recall how these
same W endat societies refused to spank children, directly punish thieves or
murderers, or take any measure against their own members that smacked of
arbitrary authority . In virtually all other areas of social life they were
renowned for solving their problems through calm and reasoned debate.
Now , it would be easy to make an ar gument that repressed aggression
must be vented in one way or another , so that or gies of communal torture
are simply the necessary ﬂipside of a non-violent community; and some
contemporary scholars do make this point. But it doesn’ t really work. In
fact, Iroquoia seems to be precisely one of those regions of North America
where violence ﬂared up only during certain speciﬁc historical periods and
then lar gely disappeared in others. In what archaeologists term the ‘MiddleWoodland’ phase, for instance, between 100 BC and AD 500 – corresponding
roughly to the heyday of the Hopewell civilization – there seems to have
been general peace.12 Later on, signs of endemic warfare reappear . Clearly ,
at some points in their history people living in this region found ef fective
ways to ensure that vendettas didn’ t escalate into a spiral of retaliation or
actual warfare (the Haudenosaunee story of the Great Law of the Peace
seems to be about precisely such a moment); at other times, the system
broke down and the possibility of sadistic cruelty returned.
What, then, was the meaning of these theatres of violence? One way to
approach the question is to compare them with what was happening in
Europe around the same time. As the Quebecois historian Denys Delâge
points out, W endat who visited France were equally appalled by the tortures
exhibited during public punishments and executions, but what struck them
as most remarkable is that ‘the French whipped, hanged, and put to death
men from among themselves ’, rather than external enemies. The point is
telling, as in seventeenth-century Europe, Delâge notes,
… almost all punishment, including the death penalty , involved
severe physical suf fering: wearing an iron collar , being whipped,
having a hand cut of f, or being branded … It was a ritual that
manifested power in a conspicuous way , thereby revealing the
existence of an internal war . The sovereign incarnated a superior
power that transcended his subjects, one that they were compelled to
recognise … While Amerindian cannibal rituals showed the desire
to take over the strength and courage of the alien so as to combat
him better , the European ritual revealed the existence of a
dissymmetry , an irrevocable imbalance of power .13
Wendat punitive actions against war captives (those not taken in for
adoption) required the community to become a single body , uniﬁed by its
capacity for violence. In France, by contrast, ‘the people’ were uniﬁed as
potential victims of the king’ s violence. But the contrasts run deeper still.
As a W endat traveller observed of the French system, anyone – guilty or
innocent – might  end up being made a public example. Among the W endat
themselves, however , violence was ﬁrmly excluded from the realm of
family and household. A captive warrior might either be treated with loving
care and af fection or be the object of the worst treatment imaginable. Nomiddle ground existed. Prisoner sacriﬁce was not merely about reinforcing
the solidarity of the group but also proclaimed the internal sanctity of the
family and the domestic realm as spaces of female governance where
violence, politics and rule by command did not belong. W endat households,
in other words, were deﬁned in exactly opposite terms to the Roman
familia .
In this particular respect, French society under the Ancien Régime
presents a rather similar picture to imperial Rome – at least, when both are
placed in the light of the W endat example. In both cases, household and
kingdom shared a common model of subordination. Each was made in the
other ’s image, with the patriarchal family serving as a template for the
absolute power of kings, and vice versa.14 Children were to be submissive
to their parents, wives to husbands, and subjects to rulers whose authority
came from God. In each case the superior party was expected to inﬂict stern
chastisement when he considered it appropriate: that is, to exercise violence
with impunity . All this, moreover , was assumed to be bound up with
feelings of love and af fection. Ultimately , the house of the Bourbon
monarchs – like the palace of an Egyptian pharaoh, Roman emperor , Aztec
tlatoani  or Sapa Inca – was not merely a structure of domination but also
one of care, where a small army of courtiers laboured night and day to
attend to the king’ s every physical need and prevent him, as much as was
humanly possible, from ever feeling anything but divine.
In all these cases, the bonds of violence and care extended downwards as
well as upwards. W e can do no better than put it in words made famous by
King James I of England in The T rue Law of Fr ee Monar chies  (1598):
As the father , of his fatherly duty , is to care for the nourishing,
education, and virtuous government of his children; even so is the
King bound to care for all his subjects … As the father ’s wrath and
correction on any of his children that of fendeth, ought to be a
fatherly chastisement seasoned with pity , so long as there is any
hope of amendment in them; so ought the King towards any of his
lieges that of fend in that measure … As the father ’s chief joy ought
to be in procuring his children’ s welfare, rejoicing in their weal,
sorrowing and pitying at their evil, to hazard for their safety … so
ought a good Prince think of his People.Public torture, in seventeenth-century Europe, created searing, unfor gettable
spectacles of pain and suf fering in order to convey the message that a
system in which husbands could brutalize wives, and parents beat children,
was ultimately a form of love. W endat torture, in the same period of history ,
created searing, unfor gettable spectacles of pain and suf fering in order to
make clear that no form of physical chastisement should ever be
countenanced inside a community or household. V iolence and care, in the
Wendat case, were to be entirely separated. Seen in this light, the distinctive
features of W endat prisoner torture come into focus.
It seems to us that this connection – or better perhaps, confusion –
between care and domination is utterly critical to the lar ger question of how
we lost the ability freely to recreate ourselves by recreating our relations
with one another . It is critical, that is, to understanding how we got stuck,
and why these days we can hardly envisage our own past or future as
anything other than a transition from smaller to lar ger cages.
In the course of writing this book, we have tried to strike a certain balance.
It would be intuitive for an archaeologist and an anthropologist, immersed
in our subject matter , to take on all the scholarly views about, say ,
Stonehenge, the ‘Uruk expansion’ or Iroquoian social or ganization and
explain our preference for one interpretation over another , or venture a
different one. This is how the search for truth is normally conducted in the
academy . But had we tried to outline or refute every existing interpretation
of the material we covered, this book would have been two or three times
the size, and likely would have left the reader with a sense that the authors
are engaged in a constant battle with demons who were in fact two inches
tall. So instead we have tried to map out what we think really happened,
and to point out the ﬂaws in other scholars’ ar guments only insofar as they
seemed to reﬂect more widespread misconceptions.
Perhaps the most stubborn misconception we’ve been tackling has to do
with scale. It does seem to be received wisdom in many quarters, academic
and otherwise, that structures of domination are the inevitable result of
populations scaling up by orders of magnitude; that is, that a necessary
correspondence exists between social and spatial hierarchies. T ime and
again we found ourselves confronted with writing which simply assumes
that the lar ger and more densely populated the social group, the more
‘complex’ the system needed to keep it or ganized. Complexity , in turn, isstill often used as a synonym for hierarchy . Hierarchy , in turn, is used as a
euphemism for chains of command (the ‘origins of the state’), which mean
that as soon as lar ge numbers of people decided to live in one place or join a
common project, they must necessarily abandon the second freedom – to
refuse orders – and replace it with legal mechanisms for , say, beating or
locking up those who don’ t do as they’re told.
As we’ve seen, none of these assumptions are theoretically essential, and
history tends not to bear them out. Carole Crumley , an anthropologist and
expert on Iron Age Europe, has been pointing this out for years: complex
systems don’ t have to be or ganized top-down, either in the natural or in the
social world. That we tend to assume otherwise probably tells us more
about ourselves than the people or phenomena that we’re studying.15
Neither is she alone in making this point. But more often than not, such
observations have fallen on deaf ears.
It’s probably time to start listening, because ‘exceptions’ are fast
beginning to outnumber the rules. T ake cities. It was once assumed that the
rise of urban life marked some kind of historical turnstile, whereby
everyone who passed through had to permanently surrender their basic
freedoms and submit to the rule of faceless administrators, stern priests,
paternalistic kings or warrior -politicians – simply to avert chaos (or
cognitive overload). T o view human history through such a lens today is
really not all that dif ferent from taking on the mantle of a modern-day King
James, since the overall ef fect is to portray the violence and inequalities of
modern society as somehow arising naturally from structures of rational
management and paternalistic care: structures designed for human
populations who, we are asked to believe, became suddenly incapable of
organizing themselves once their numbers expanded above a certain
threshold.
Not only do such views lack a sound basis in human psychology . They
are also difﬁcult to reconcile with archaeological evidence of how cities
actually began in many parts of the world: as civic experiments on a grand
scale, which frequently lacked the expected features of administrative
hierarchy and authoritarian rule. W e do not possess an adequate
terminology for these early cities. T o call them ‘egalitarian’, as we’ve seen,
could mean quite a number of dif ferent things. It might imply an urban
parliament and co-ordinated projects of social housing, as with some pre-
Columbian centres in the Americas; or the self-or ganizing of autonomoushouseholds into neighbourhoods and citizens’ assemblies, as with
prehistoric mega-sites north of the Black Sea; or , perhaps, the introduction
of some explicit notion of equality based on principles of uniformity and
sameness, as in Uruk-period Mesopotamia.
None of this variability is surprising once we recall what preceded cities
in each region. That was not, in fact, rudimentary or isolated groups, but
far-ﬂung networks of societies, spanning diverse ecologies, with people,
plants, animals, drugs, objects of value, songs and ideas moving between
them in endlessly intricate ways. While the individual units were
demographically small, especially at certain times of year , they were
typically or ganized into loose coalitions or confederacies. At the very least,
these were simply the logical outcome of our ﬁrst freedom: to move away
from one’ s home, knowing one will be received and cared for , even valued,
in some distant place. At most they were examples of ‘amphictyony’, in
which some kind of formal or ganization was put in char ge of the care and
maintenance of sacred places. It seems that Marcel Mauss had a point when
he ar gued that we should reserve the term ‘civilization’ for great hospitality
zones such as these. Of course, we are used to thinking of ‘civilization’ as
something that originates in cities – but, armed with new knowledge, it
seems more realistic to put things the other way round and to imagine the
ﬁrst cities as one of those great regional confederacies, compressed into a
small space.
Of course, monarchy , warrior aristocracies or other forms of stratiﬁcation
could also take hold in urban contexts, and often did. When this happened
the consequences were dramatic. Still, the mere existence of lar ge human
settlements in no way caused these phenomena, and certainly didn’ t make
them inevitable. For the origins of these structures of domination we must
look elsewhere. Hereditary aristocracies were just as likely to exist among
demographically small or modest-sized groups, such as the ‘heroic
societies’ of the Anatolian highlands, which took form on the mar gins of
the ﬁrst Mesopotamian cities and traded extensively with them. Insofar as
we have evidence for the inception of monarchy as a permanent institution
it seems to lie precisely there, and not in cities. In other parts of the world,
some urban populations ventured partway down the road towards
monarchy , only to turn back. Such was the case at T eotihuacan in the V alley
of Mexico, where the city’ s population – having raised the Pyramids of the
Sun and Moon – then abandoned such aggrandizing projects and embarkedinstead on a prodigious programme of social housing, providing multi-
family apartments for its residents.
Elsewhere, early cities followed the opposite trajectory , starting with
neighbourhood councils and popular assemblies and ending up being ruled
by warlike dynasts, who then had to maintain an uneasy coexistence with
older institutions of urban governance. Something along these lines took
place in Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, after the Uruk period: here again the
conver gence between systems of violence and systems of care seems
critical. Sumerian temples had always or ganized their economic existence
around the nurturing and feeding of the gods, embodied in their cult statues,
which became surrounded by a whole industry and bureaucracy of welfare.
Even more crucially , temples were charitable institutions. W idows, orphans,
runaways, those exiled from their kin groups or other support networks
would take refuge there: at Uruk, for example, in the T emple of Inanna,
protective goddess of the city , overlooking the great courtyard of the city’ s
assembly .
The ﬁrst charismatic war -kings attached themselves to such spaces, quite
literally moving in next door to the residence of the city’ s leading deity . In
such ways, Sumerian monarchs were able to insert themselves into
institutional spaces once reserved for the care of the gods, and thus removed
from the realm of ordinary human relationships. This makes sense because
kings, as the Malagasy proverb puts it, ‘have no relatives’ – or they
shouldn’ t, since they are rulers equally of all their subjects. Slaves too have
no kin; they are severed from all prior attachments. In either case, the only
recognized social relationships such individuals possess are those based on
power and domination. In structural terms, and as against almost everyone
else in society , kings and slaves ef fectively inhabit the same ground. The
difference lies in which end of the power spectrum they happen to occupy .
We also know that needy individuals, taken into such temple institutions,
were supplied with regular rations and put to work on the temple’ s lands
and in its workshops. The very ﬁrst factories – or , at least, the very ﬁrst we
are aware of in history – were charitable institutions of this kind, where
temple bureaucrats would supply women with wool to spin and weave,
supervise the disposal of the product (much of it traded with upland groups
in exchange for wood, stone and metal, unavailable in the river valleys),
and provide them with carefully apportioned rations. All this was already
true long before the appearance of kings. As persons dedicated to the gods,these women must originally have had a certain dignity , even a sacred
status; but already by the time of the ﬁrst written documents, the situation
seems to have grown more complicated.
By then, some of those working in Sumerian temples were also war
captives, or even slaves, who were similarly bereft of family support. Over
time, and perhaps as a result, the status of widows and orphans also appears
to have been downgraded, until the temple institutions came to resemble
something more like a V ictorian poorhouse. How , we might then ask, did
the degradation of women working in the temple factories af fect the status
of women more generally? If nothing else, it must have made the prospect
of ﬂeeing an abusive domestic arrangement far more daunting. Loss of the
ﬁrst freedom meant, increasingly , loss of the second. Loss of the second
meant ef facement of the third. If a woman in such a situation attempted to
create a new cult, a new temple, a new vision of social relations she would
instantly be marked as a subversive, a revolutionary; if she attracted
followers she might well ﬁnd herself confronted by military force.
All this brings into focus another question. Does this newly established
nexus between external violence and internal care – between the most
impersonal and the most intimate of human relations – mark the point
where everything begins to get confused? Is this an example of how
relations that were once ﬂexible and negotiable ended up getting ﬁxed in
place: an example, in other words, of how we ef fectively got stuck? If there
is a particular story we should be telling, a big question we should be asking
of human history (instead of the ‘origins of social inequality’), is it
precisely this: how did we ﬁnd ourselves stuck in just one form of social
reality , and how did relations based ultimately on violence and domination
come to be normalized within it?
Perhaps the scholar who most closely approached this question in the last
century was an anthropologist and poet named Franz Steiner , who died in
1952. Steiner led a fascinating if tragic life. A brilliant polymath born to a
Jewish family in Bohemia, he later lived with an Arab family in Jerusalem
until expelled by the British authorities, conducted ﬁeldwork in the
Carpathians and was twice forced by the Nazis to ﬂee the continent, ending
his career – ironically enough – in the south of England. Most of his
immediate family were killed at Birkenau. Legend has it that he completed
800 pages of a monumental doctoral dissertation on the comparative
sociology of slavery , only to have the suitcase containing his drafts andresearch notes stolen on a train. He was friends with, and a romantic rival
to, Elias Canetti, another Jewish exile at Oxford and a successful suitor to
the novelist Iris Murdoch – although two days after she’d accepted his
proposal of marriage, Steiner died of a heart attack. He was forty-three.
The shorter version of Steiner ’s doctoral work, which does survive,
focuses on what he calls ‘pre-servile institutions’. Poignantly , given his own
life story , it is a study of what happens in dif ferent cultural and historical
situations to people who become unmoored: those expelled from their clans
for some debt or fault; castaways, criminals, runaways. It can be read as a
history of how refugees such as himself were ﬁrst welcomed, treated as
almost sacred beings, then gradually degraded and exploited, again much
like the women working in the Sumerian temple factories. In essence, the
story told by Steiner appears to be precisely about the collapse of what we
would term the ﬁrst basic freedom (to move away or relocate), and how this
paved the way for the loss of the second (the freedom to disobey). It also
leads us back to a point we made earlier about the progressive division of
the human social universe into smaller and smaller units, beginning with the
appearance of ‘culture areas’ (a fascination of ethnologists in the central
European tradition, in which Steiner ﬁrst trained).
What happens, Steiner asked, when expectations that make freedom of
movement possible – the norms of hospitality and asylum, civility and
shelter – erode? Why does this so often appear to be a catalyst for situations
where some people can exert arbitrary power over others? Steiner worked
his way in careful detail through cases ranging from the Amazonian Huitoto
and East African Safwa to the T ibeto-Burman Lushai. Along the journey he
suggested one possible answer to the question that had so puzzled Robert
Lowie, and later Clastres: if stateless societies do regularly or ganize
themselves in such a way that chiefs have no coercive power , then how did
top-down forms of or ganization ever come into the world to begin with?
You’ll recall how both Lowie and Clastres were driven to the same
conclusion: that they must have been the product of religious revelation.
Steiner provided an alternative route. Perhaps, he suggested, it all goes back
to charity .
In Amazonian societies, not only orphans but also widows, the mad,
disabled or deformed – if they had no one else to look after them – were
allowed to take refuge in the chief ’s residence, where they received a share
of communal meals. T o these were occasionally added war captives,especially children taken in raiding expeditions. Among the Safwa or
Lushai, runaways, debtors, criminals or others needing protection held the
same status as those who surrendered in battle. All became members of the
chief ’s retinue, and the younger males often took on the role of police-like
enforcers. How much power the chief actually had over his retainers –
Steiner uses the Roman Law term potestas , which denotes among other
things a father ’s power of arbitrary command over his dependants and their
property – would vary , depending how easy it was for wards to run away
and ﬁnd refuge elsewhere, or to maintain at least some ties with relatives,
clans or outsiders willing to stand up for them. How far such henchmen
could be relied on to enforce the chief ’s will also varied; but the sheer
potential was important.
In all such cases, the process of giving refuge did generally lead to the
transformation of basic domestic arrangements, especially as captured
women were incorporated, further reinforcing the potestas  of fathers. It is
possible to detect something of this logic in almost all historically
documented royal courts, which invariably attracted those considered
freakish or detached. There seems to have been no region of the world,
from China to the Andes, where courtly societies did not host such
obviously distinctive individuals; and few monarchs who did not also claim
to be the protectors of widows and orphans. One could easily imagine
something along these lines was already happening in certain hunter -
gatherer communities during much earlier periods of history . The physically
anomalous individuals accorded lavish burials in the last Ice Age must also
have been the focus of much caring attention while alive. No doubt there
are sequences of development linking such practices to later royal courts –
we’ve caught glimpses of them, as in Predynastic Egypt – even if we are
still unable to reconstruct most of the links.
Steiner may not have foregrounded the issue, but his observations are
directly relevant to debates about the origins of patriarchy . Feminist
anthropologists have long ar gued for a connection between external (lar gely
male) violence and the transformation of women’ s status in the home. In
archaeological and historical terms, we are only just beginning to gather
together enough material to begin understanding how that process actually
worked.The research that culminated in this book began almost a decade ago,
essentially as a form of play . We pursued it at ﬁrst, it would be fair to say , in
a spirit of mild deﬁance towards our more ‘serious’ academic
responsibilities. Mainly we were just curious about how the new
archaeological evidence that had been building up for the last thirty years
might change our notions of early human history , especially the parts bound
up with debates on the origins of social inequality . Before long, though, we
realized that what we were doing was potentially important, because hardly
anyone else in our ﬁelds seemed to be doing this work of synthesis. Often,
we found ourselves searching in vain for books that we assumed must exist
but, it turns out, simply didn’ t – for instance, compendia of early cities that
lacked top-down governance, or accounts of how democratic decision-
making was conducted in Africa or the Americas, or comparisons of what
we’ve called ‘heroic societies’. The literature is riddled with absences.
We eventually came to realize that this reluctance to synthesize was not
simply a product of reticence on the part of highly specialized scholars,
although this is certainly a factor . To some degree it was simply the lack of
an appropriate language. What, for instance, does one even call a ‘city
lacking top-down structures of governance’? At the moment there is no
commonly accepted term. Dare one call it a ‘democracy’? A ‘republic’?
Such words (like ‘civilization’) are so freighted with historical baggage that
most archaeologists and anthropologists instinctively recoil from them, and
historians tend to limit their use to Europe. Does one, then, call it an
‘egalitarian city’? Probably not, since to evoke such a term is to invite the
obvious demand for proof that the city was ‘really’ egalitarian – which
usually means, in practice, showing that no element of structural inequality
existed in any aspect of its inhabitants’ lives, including households and
religious arrangements. Since such evidence will rarely , if ever , be
forthcoming, the conclusion would have to be that these are not really
egalitarian cities after all.
By the same logic, one might easily conclude there aren’ t really any
‘egalitarian societies’, except possibly certain very small foraging bands.
Many researchers in the ﬁeld of evolutionary anthropology do, in fact, make
precisely this ar gument. But ultimately the result of this kind of thinking is
to lump together all ‘non-egalitarian’ cities or indeed all ‘non-egalitarian
societies’, which is a little like saying there’ s no meaningful dif ference
between a hippie commune and a biker gang, since neither are entirely non-violent. All this achieves, at the end of the day , is to leave us literally at a
loss for words when confronted with certain major aspects of human
history . We fall strangely mute in the face of any kind of evidence for
humans doing something other than ‘rushing headlong for their chains’.
Sensing a sea change in the evidence of the past, we decided to approach
things the other way round.
What this meant, in practice, was reversing a lot of polarities. It meant
ditching the language of ‘equality’ and ‘inequality’, unless there was
explicit evidence that ideologies of social equality were actually present on
the ground. It meant asking, for instance, what happens if we accord
signiﬁcance to the 5,000 years in which cereal domestication did not lead to
the emer gence of pampered aristocracies, standing armies or debt peonage,
rather than just the 5,000 in which it did? What happens if we treat the
rejection of urban life, or of slavery , in certain times and places as
something just as signiﬁcant as the emer gence of those same phenomena in
others? In the process, we often found ourselves surprised. W e’d never have
guessed, for instance, that slavery was most likely abolished multiple times
in history in multiple places; and that very possibly the same is true of war .
Obviously , such abolitions are rarely deﬁnitive. Still, the periods in which
free or relatively free societies existed are hardly insigniﬁcant. In fact, if
you bracket the Eurasian Iron Age (which is ef fectively what we have been
doing here), they represent the vast majority of human social experience.
Social theorists have a tendency to write about the past as if everything
that happened could have been predicted beforehand. This is somewhat
dishonest, since we’re all aware that when we actually try to predict the
future we almost invariably get it wrong – and this is just as true of social
theorists as anybody else. Nonetheless, it’ s hard to resist the temptation to
write and think as if the current state of the world, in the early twenty-ﬁrst
century , is the inevitable outcome of the last 10,000 years of history , while
in reality , of course, we have little or no idea what the world will be like
even in 2075, let alone 2150.
Who knows? Perhaps if our species does endure, and we one day look
backwards from this as yet unknowable future, aspects of the remote past
that now seem like anomalies – say , bureaucracies that work on a
community scale; cities governed by neighbourhood councils; systems of
government where women hold a preponderance of formal positions; or
forms of land management based on care-taking rather than ownership andextraction – will seem like the really signiﬁcant breakthroughs, and great
stone pyramids or statues more like historical curiosities. What if we were
to take that approach now and look at, say , Minoan Crete or Hopewell not
as random bumps on a road that leads inexorably to states and empires, but
as alternative possibilities: roads not taken?
After all, those things really did exist, even if our habitual ways of
looking at the past seem designed to put them at the mar gins rather than at
the centre of things. Much of this book has been devoted to recalibrating
those scales; to reminding us that people did actually live in those ways,
often for many centuries, even millennia. In some ways, such a perspective
might seem even more tragic than our standard narrative of civilization as
the inevitable fall from grace. It means we could  have been living under
radically dif ferent conceptions of what human society is actually about. It
means that mass enslavement, genocide, prison camps, even patriarchy or
regimes of wage labour never had to happen. But on the other hand it also
suggests that, even now , the possibilities for human intervention are far
greater than we’re inclined to think.
We began this book with a quote which refers to the Greek notion of kairos
as one of those occasional moments in a society’ s history when its frames of
reference under go a shift – a metamorphosis of the fundamental principles
and symbols, when the lines between myth and history , science and magic
become blurred – and, therefore, real change is possible. Philosophers
sometimes like to speak of ‘the Event’ – a political revolution, a scientiﬁc
discovery , an artistic masterpiece – that is, a breakthrough which reveals
aspects of reality that had previously been unimaginable but, once seen, can
never be unseen. If so, kairos is the kind of time in which Events are prone
to happen.
Societies around the world appear to be cascading towards such a point.
This is particularly true of those which, since the First W orld W ar, have
been in the habit of calling themselves ‘W estern’. On the one hand,
fundamental breakthroughs in the physical sciences, or even artistic
expression, no longer seem to occur with anything like the regularity people
came to expect in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Y et at
the same time, our scientiﬁc means of understanding the past, not just our
species’ past but that of our planet, has been advancing with dizzying
speed. Scientists in 2020 are not (as readers of mid-twentieth-centuryscience ﬁction might have hoped) encountering alien civilizations in distant
star systems; but they are encountering radically dif ferent forms of society
under their own feet, some for gotten and newly rediscovered, others more
familiar , but now understood in entirely new ways.
In developing the scientiﬁc means to know our own past, we have
exposed the mythical substructure of our ‘social science’ – what once
appeared unassailable axioms, the stable points around which our self-
knowledge is or ganized, are scattering like mice. What is the purpose of all
this new knowledge, if not to reshape our conceptions of who we are and
what we might yet become? If not, in other words, to rediscover the
meaning of our third basic freedom: the freedom to create new and dif ferent
forms of social reality?
Myth in itself is not the problem here. It shouldn’ t be mistaken for bad or
infantile science. Just as all societies have their science, all societies have
their myths. Myth is the way in which human societies give structure and
meaning to experience. But the lar ger mythic structures of history we’ve
been deploying for the last several centuries simply don’ t work any more;
they are impossible to reconcile with the evidence now before our eyes, and
the structures and meanings they encourage are tawdry , shop-worn and
politically disastrous.
No doubt, for a while at least, very little will change. Whole ﬁelds of
knowledge – not to mention university chairs and departments, scientiﬁc
journals, prestigious research grants, libraries, databases, school curricula
and the like – have been designed to ﬁt the old structures and the old
questions. Max Planck once remarked that new scientiﬁc truths don’ t
replace old ones by convincing established scientists that they were wrong;
they do so because proponents of the older theory eventually die, and
generations that follow ﬁnd the new truths and theories to be familiar ,
obvious even. W e are optimists. W e like to think it will not take that long.
In fact, we have already taken a ﬁrst step. W e can see more clearly now
what is going on when, for example, a study that is rigorous in every other
respect begins from the unexamined assumption that there was some
‘original’ form of human society; that its nature was fundamentally good or
evil; that a time before inequality and political awareness existed; that
something happened to change all this; that ‘civilization’ and ‘complexity’
always come at the price of human freedoms; that participatory democracyis natural in small groups but cannot possibly scale up to anything like a
city or a nation state.
We know , now , that we are in the presence of myths.
