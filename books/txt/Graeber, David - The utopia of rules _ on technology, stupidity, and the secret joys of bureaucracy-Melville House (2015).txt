Introduction 
The Iron Law of 
Liberalism and the Era of 
Total Bureaucratization 
Nowadays, nobody talks much about bureaucracy. But in the 
middle of the last century , particularly in the late sixties and early 
seventies, the word was everyw here. There were sociological 
tomes with grandiose titles like A General Theory of Bureaucra cy,' 
The Politics of Bureaucracy,' or even The Bureaucr atization of the 
Wc>rld,' and popular paperback screeds with titles like Parkinson� 
Law,4 The Peter Princip le,5 or Bureauc rats: How to Annoy Them.' 
There were Kafkaesque novels, and satirical films. Everyone 
seemed to feel that the foibles and absurdities ofbureaucratic life 
and bureaucratic procedures were one of the defining features 
of modern existence, and as such, eminently worth discussing. 
But since the seventies, there has been a peculiar falling off. 
Consider, for example, the following table, which diagrams 
how frequently the word "bureaucracy" appears in books writ­
ten in English over the last century and a half. A subject of 
only moderate interest until the postwar period, it shoots into 
prominence starting in the fifties and then, after a pinnacle in 
1973, begins a slow but inexorable decline.

Wh y? Well, one obvious reason is that we've just become 
accustomed to it. Bureaucracy has become the water in which 
we swim. Now let's imagine another graph, one that simply 
documented the average number of hours per year a typical 
Amer ican-or a Briton , or an inhabitant ofThailand-spent 
filling out forms or otherwise fulfill ing purely bureaucratic 
obligations. (Needless to say, the overwhelming majority of 
these obligations no longer involve actual, physical paper.) This 
graph would ·almost certainly show a line much . like the one 
in the first graph-a slow climb until 1973. But here the two 
graphs would diverg e-- rather than falling back, the line would 
continue to climb; if anything, it would do so more precipi­
tously, tracking how, in the late twentieth century, middle-class 
citizens spent ever more hours struggling with phone trees and 
web interfaces, while the less fortunate spent ever more hours 
of their day trying to jump through the increasingly elaborate 
hoops required to gain access to dwindling social services.

This is not a graph of hours spent on paperwork,just of how 
often the word "paperwork" has been used in English-language 
books. But absent time machines that could allow us to carry 
out a more direct investigation, this is about as close as we're 
likely to get. 
By the way, most similar paperwork-related terms yield 
almost identical results:

REVIEW 
The essays assembled in this volume are all, in one way or 
another, about this disparity. We no longer like to think about 
bureaucracy, yet it informs every aspect of our existence. It's as 
if, as a planetary civilization, we have decided to clap our hands 
over our ears and start humming whenever the topic comes up. 
Insofar as we are even willing to discuss it, it's still in the terms 
popular in the sixties and early seventies. The social movements 
of the sixties were, on the whole, left-wing in inspiration, but 
they were also rebellions against bureaucracy, or, to put it more 
accurately, rebellions against the bureaucratic mindset, against 
the soul-destroying conformity of the postwar welfare states. 
In the face of the gray functionaries of both state-capitalist 
and state-socialist regimes, sixties rebels stood for individual 
expression and spontaneous conviviality, and against ("rules and 
regulations, who needs them?") every form of social control. 
With the collapse of the old welfare states, all this has come 
to seem decidedly quaint. As the language of antibureaucratic 
individualism has been adopted, with increasing ferocity, by 
the Right, which insists on "market solutions" to every social 
5 The Utopia of Rules 
problem, the mainstream Left has increasingly reduced itself to 
fighting a kind of pathetic rearguard action, trying to salvage 
remnants of the old welfare state: it has acquiesced with-often 
even spearheaded-attempts to make government efforts more 
"efficient" through the partial privatization of services and 
the incorporation of ever-more "market principles," "market 
incentives," and market-based "accountability processes" into 
the structure of the bureaucracy itself. 
The result is a political catastrophe. There's really no other 
way to put it. What is presented as the "moderate" Left solution 
to any social problems-and radical left solutions are, almost 
ever ywh ere now, ruled out tout court-has invariably come to 
be some nightmare fusion of the worst elements of bureaucracy 
and the worst elements of capitalism. It's as if someone had 
consciously tried to create the least appealing possible politi­
cal position. It is a testimony to the genuine lingering power 
of leftist ideals that anyone would even consider voting for a 
party that promoted this sort of thing-because surely, if they 
do, it's not because they actually think these are good policies, 
but because these are the only policies anyone who identifies 
themselves as left-of-center is allowed to set forth. 
Is there any wonder, then, that every time there is a social 
crisis, it is the Right, rather than the Left, which becomes the 
venue for the expression of popular anger? 
The Right, at least, has a critique of bureaucracy. It's not 
a very good one. But at least it exists. The Left has none. As a 
result, when those who identify with the Left do have anything 
negative to say about bureaucracy, they are usually forced to 
adopt a watered-down version of the right-wing critique. 7 
This right-wing critique can be disposed of fairly quickly. It 
has its origins in nineteenth-century liberalism.' The story that 
emerged in middle-class circles in Europe in the wake of the 
6 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
French revolution was that the civilized world was experienc­
ing a gradual, uneven, but inevitable transformation away from 
the rule of warrior elites, with their authoritarian governments, 
their priestly dogmas, and their caste-like stratification, to one 
of liberty , equality, and enlightened commercial self-interest. 
The mercantile classes in the Middle Ages undermined the old 
feudal order like termites munching from below-termites, yes, 
but the good kind. The pomp and splendor of the absolutist 
states that were being overthrown were, according to the liberal 
version of history, the last gasps of the old order, which would 
end as states gave way to markets, religious faith to scientific 
understanding, and fixed orders and statuses of Marquis and 
Baronesses and the like to free contracts between individuals. 
The emergence of modern bureaucracies was always some­
thing of a problem for this story because it didn't really fit. In 
principle, all these stuffy functionaries in their offices, with their 
elaborate chains of command, should have been mere feudal 
holdovers, soon to go the way of the armies and officer corps 
that everyone was expecting to gradually become unnecessary 
as well. One need only flip open a Russian novel from the. late 
nineteenth century: all the scions of old aristocratic families­
in fact, almost everyone in those books-had been transformed 
into either military officers or civil servants (no one of any 
notice seems to do anything else), and the military and civil 
hierarchies seemed to have nearly identical ranks, titles, and 
sensibilities. But there was an obvious problem. If bureaucrats 
were just holdovers, why was it that every where-not just in 
backwaters like Russia but in booming industrial societies like 
England and Germany-every year seemed to bring more and 
more of them? 
There followed stage two of the argument, which was, in 
its essence, that bureaucracy represents an inherent flaw in 
the democratic project.' Its greatest exponent was Ludwig 
von Mises, an exiled Austrian aristocrat, whose 1944 book 
7 The Utopia of Rules 
Burea ucracy argued that by definition, systems of government 
administration could never organize information with anything 
like the efficiency of impersonal market pricing mechanisms. 
However, extending the vote to the losers of the economic 
game would inevitably lead to calls for government interven­
tion, framed as high-minded schemes for trying to solve social 
problems through administrative means. Von Mises was will­
ing to admit that many of those who embraced such solutions 
were entirely well-meaning; however, their efforts could only 
make matters worse. In fact, he felt they would ultimately end 
up destroying the political basis of democracy itself, since the 
administrators of social programs would inevitably form power­
blocs far more influential than the politicians elected to run the 
government, and support ever-more radical reforms.Von Mises 
argued that as a result, the social welfare states then emerging 
in places like France or England, let alone Denmark or Sweden, 
would, within a generation or two, inevitably lead to fascism. 
In this view, the rise ofbureaucracy was the ultimate example 
of good intentions run amok. Ronald Reagan probably made 
the most effective popular deployment of this line of thought 
with his famous claim that, "the nine most terrifying words in 
the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm 
here to help.' " 
The problem with all this is that it bears very little relation 
to what actually happened. First of all, historically, markets sim­
ply did not emerge as some autonomous domain of freedom 
independent of, and opposed to, state authorities. Exactly the 
opposite is the case. Historica lly, markets are generally eit.her a 
side effect of government operations, especially military opera­
tions, or were directly created by government policy . This has 
been true at least since the invention of coinage, which was first 
created and promulgated as a means of provisioning soldiers; for 
most of Eurasian history , ordinary people used informal credit 
arrangements and physical money, gold, silver, bronze, and 
8 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
the kind of impersonal markets they made possible remained 
mainly an adjunct to the mobilization of legions, sacking of 
cities, extraction of tribute, and disposing ofloot. Modern cen­
tral banking systems were likewise first created to finance wars. 
So there's one initial problem with the conventional history. 
There's another even more dramatic one. While the idea that 
the market is somehow opposed to and independent of govern­
ment has been used at least at least since the nineteenth century 
to justify laissez faire economic policies designed to lessen the 
role of government, they never actually have that effect. En­
glish liberalism, for instance, did not lead to a reduction of state 
bureaucr acy, but the exact opposite: an endlessly ballooning 
array of legal clerks, registrars, inspectors, notaries, and police 
officials who made the liberal dream of a world of free contract 
between autonomous individuals possible. It turned out that 
maintaining a free market economy required a thousand times 
more paperwork than a Louis XIV-style absolutist monarchy .. 
This apparent paradox-that government policies intending 
to reduce government interference in the economy actually 
end up producing more regulations, more bureaucrats, and 
more police-can be observed so regularly that I think we are 
·justified in treating it as a general sociological law. I propose to 
call it "the iron law of liberalism": 
The Iron Law of Liberalism states that any market 
reform, any government initiative intended to reduce 
red tape and promote market forces will have the 
ultimate effect of increasing the total number of regu­
lations, the total amount of paperwork, and the total 
number of bureaucrats the government employs. 
French sociologist Emile Durkheim was already observ­
ing this tendency at the turn of the twentieth century,1° and 
eventually; it became impossible to ignore. By the middle of the 
9 The Utopia of Rules 
century, even right-wing critics like von Mises were willing to 
admit-at least in their academic writing-that markets don't 
really regulate themselves, and that an army of administrators 
was indeed required to keep any market system going. (For 
von Mises, that army only became problematic when it was 
deployed to alter market outcomes that caused undue suffer­
ing for the poor.)11 Still, right-wing populists soon realized 
that, whatever the realities, making a target of bureaucrats 
was almost always effective. Hence, in their public pronounce­
ments, the condemnation of what U.S. governor George 
Wallace, in his 1968 campaign for President, first labeled 
"pointy-headed bureaucrats" living off hardworking citizens' 
taxes, was unrelenting. 
Wallace is actually a crucial figure here. Nowadays, Ameri­
cans mainly remember him as a failed reactionary , or even a 
snarling lunatic: the last die-hard Southern segregationist stand­
ing with an axe outside a public school door. But in terms of 
his broader legacy, he could just as well be represented as a 
kind of political genius. He was, after all, the first politician to 
create a national platform for a kind of right-wing populism 
that was soon to prove so infectious that by now, a genera­
tion later, it has come to be adopted by pretty much everyone, 
across the political spectrum. As a result, amongst working-class 
Ameri cans, government is now generally seen as being made 
up of two sorts of people: "politic ians," who are blustering 
crooks and liars but can at least occasionally be voted out of 
office, and "bureaucrats," who are condescending elitists almost 
impossible to uproot. There is assumed to be a kind of tacit alli­
ance between what came to be seen as the parasitical poor (in 
America usually pictured in overtly racist terms) and the equally 
parasitical self-righteous officials whose existence depends on 
subsidizing the poor using other people's money. Again, even 
the mainstream Left-or what it is supposed to pass for a Left 
these days-has come to offer little more than a watered-down 
10 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
version of this right-wing language. Bill Clinton, for instance, 
had spent so much of his career bashing civil servants that after 
the Oklahoma City bombing, he actually felt moved to remind 
Americans that public servants were human beings unto them­
selves, and promised never to use the word "bureaucrat" again. 12 
In contemporary American populism--and increasingly, in 
the rest of the world as well-there can be only one alterna­
tive to "bureaucracy," and that is "the market." Sometimes this 
is held to mean that government should be run more like a 
business. Sometimes it is held to mean we should simply get 
the bureaucrats out of the way and let nature take its course, 
which means letting people attend to the business of their lives 
untrammelled by endless rules and regulations imposed on 
them from above, and so allowing the magic of the marketplace 
to provide its own solutions. 
"Democracy" thus came, to mean the market; "bureaucracy," 
in turn, government interference with the market; and this is 
pretty much what the word continues to mean to this day. 
It wasn't always so. The rise of the modern corporation, in the 
late nineteenth century, was largely seen at the time as a matter 
of applying modern, bureaucratic techniques to the private sec­
tor--an d these techniques were assumed to be required, when 
operating on a large scale, because they were more efficient 
than the netw orks of personal or informal connections that had 
dominated a world of small family firms. The pioneers of these 
new, private bureaucracies were the United States and Ger­
many, and Max Weber, the German sociologist, observed that 
Americans in his day were particularly inclined to see public 
and private bureaucracies as essentially the same animal: 
The body of officials actively engaged in a "public" 
office, along with the respective apparatus of material 
11 The Utopia of Rules 
implements and the files, make up a "bureau." In private 
enterprise, "the bureau" is often called "the office" ... 
It is the peculiarity of the modern entrepreneur that 
he conducts himself as the "first official" of his corpo­
ration, in the very same way in which the ruler of a 
specifically modern bureaucratic state spoke of him­
self as "the first servant" of the state. The idea that the 
bureau activities of the state are intrin sically different in 
character from the management of private economic 
offices is a continental European notion and, by way of 
contrast, is totally foreign to the American way. 13 
In other words, around the turn of the century, rather than 
anyone complaining that government should be run more like 
a business, Americans simply assumed that governments and 
business-or big business, at any rate-- were run the same way. 
True, for much of the nineteenth century, the United.States 
was largely an economy of small family firms and high finance-­
much like Britain's at the time. But America's advent as a power 
on the world stage at the end of the century corresponded to the 
rise of a distinctly American form: corporat e-- bureaucratic­
capitalism. As Giovanni Arrighi pointed out, an analogous cor­
porate model was emerging at the same time in Germany, and 
the two countries-the United States and Germany-ended 
up spending most of the first half of the next century battling 
over which would take over from the declining British empire 
and establish its own vision for a global economic and political 
order. We all know who won.Arrighi makes another interesting 
point here. Unl ike the British Empire, which had taken its free 
market rhetoric seriously, eliminating its own protective tariffs 
with the famous Anti-Corn Law Bill of 1846, neither the Ger­
man or American regimes had ever been especially interested in 
free trade. The Americans in particular were much more con­
cerned with creating structures of international administration. 
12 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
The very first thing the United States did, on officially taking 
over the reins from Great Britain after World War II, was to set 
up the world's first genuinely planetary bureaucratic institutions 
in the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions-the 
International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and GATT , later to 
become the WT O. The British Empire had never attempted 
anything like this. They either conquered other nations, or 
traded with them. The Americans attempted to administer 
everything and everyone. 
British people, I've observed, are quite proud that they are 
not especially skilled at bureaucracy; Americans, in contrast, 
seem embarrassed by the fact that on the whole, they're really 
quite good at it.14 It doesn't fit the American self-image. We're 
supposed to be self-reliant individualists. (This is precisely why 
the right-wing populist demonization ofbureaucrats is so effec­
tive.) Yet the fact remains the United States is-an d for a well 
over a century has been-a profoundly bureaucratic society. The 
reason it is so easy to overlook is because mostAmerican bureau­
cratic habits and sensibilities-from the clothing to the language 
to the design of forms and offices-emerged from the pri­
vate sector. Wh en novelists and sociologists described the 
"Organization Man," or "the Man in the Gray Flannel Suit;' 
the soullessly conformist U.S. equivalent to the Soviet apparat­
chik, they were not talking about functionaries in the Depart­
ment of Landmarks and Preservation or the Social Security 
Administration-they were describing corporate middle man­
agement. True, by that time, corporate bureaucrats were not 
actually being called bureaucrats. But they were still setting the 
standard for what administrative functionaries were supposed 
to be like. 
The impression that the word "bureaucrat" sqould be 
treated as a synonym for "civil servant" can be traced back 
to the New Deal in the thirties, which was also the moment 
when bureaucratic structures and techniques first became 
13 The Utopia of Rules 
dramatically visible in many ordinary people's lives. But in fact, 
from the very beginning, Roosevelt's New Dealers worked in 
close coordination with the battalions of lawyers, engineers, 
and corporate bureaucrats employed by firms like Ford, Coca 
Cola, or Proctor & Gamble, absorbing much of their style and 
sensibilities, and--as the United States shifted to war footing 
in the forties-so did the gargantuan bureaucracy of the U.S. 
military.And, of course, the United States has.never really gone 
off war footing ever since. Still, through these means, the word 
"bureaucrat" came to attach itself almost exclusively to civil 
servants: even if what they do all day is sit at desks, fill out forms, 
and file reports, neither middle managers nor military officers 
are ever quite considered bureaucrats. (Neither for that matter 
are police, or employees of the NSA.) 
In the United States, the lines between public and private have 
long been blurry . The American military, for example, is famous 
for its revolving door-high-ranking officers involved in pro­
curement regularly end up on the boards of corporations that 
operate on military contracts. On a broader level, the need to 
preserve certain domestic industries for military purposes, and 
to develop others, has allowed the U.S. government to engage 
in practically Soviet-style industrial planning without ever 
having to admit it's doing so. After all, pretty much anything, 
from maintaining a certain number of steel plants, to doing 
the initial research to set up the Internet, can be justified on 
grounds of military preparedness. Yet again, since this kind of 
planning operates via an alliance between military bureaucrats 
and corporate bureaucrats, it's never perceived as something 
bureaucratic at all. 
Still, with the rise of the financial sector, things have reached 
a qualitatively different level-one where it is becoming almost 
impossible to say what is public and what is private. This is not 
14 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
just due to the much-noted outsourcing of one-time govern­
ment functions to private corporati ons.Above all, it's due to the 
way the private corporations themselves have come to operate. 
Let me give an example. A few weeks ago, I spent several 
hours on the phone with Bank of Ainerica, trying to work 
out how to get access to my account information from over­
seas. This involved speaking to four different representatives, 
two referrals to nonexistent numbers, three long explanations 
of complicated and apparently arbitrary rules, and two failed 
attempts to change outdated address and phone number infor­
mation lodged on various computer systems. In other words, it 
was the very definition of a bureaucratic runaround. (Neither 
was I able, when it was all over, to actually access my account.) 
Now; there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that, were 
I to actually locate a bank manager and demand to know how 
such things could happen, he or she would immediately insist 
that the bank was not to blame-that it was all an effect of an 
arcane maze of government regulations. However, I am equally 
confident that, were it possible to investigate how these regula­
tions came about, one would find that they were composed 
jointly by aides to legislators on some banking committee and 
lobbyists and attorneys employed by the banks themselves, in 
a process greased by generous contri butions to the coffers of 
those same legislators' reelection campaigns. And the same 
would be true of anything from credit ratings, insurance pre­
miums, mortgage applications, to, for that matter; the process of 
buying an airline ticket, applying for a scuba license, or trying to 
requisition an ergonomic chair for one's office in an ostensibly 
private university. The vast majority of the paperwork we do 
exists in just this sort of in-between zone-ostensibly priva te, 
but in fact entirely shaped by a government that provides the 
legal framework, underpins the rules with its courts and all of 
the elaborate mechanisms of enforcement that come with them, 
but-crucially-works closely with the private concerns to 
15 The Utopia of Rules 
ensure that the results will guarantee a certain rate of private 
profit. 
In cases like this the language we employ-derived as it is 
from the right-wing critique-is completely inadequate. It tells 
us nothing about what is actually going on.15 
Consider the word "deregulation." In today's political dis­
course, "deregulation" is-like "ref orm"-almost invariably 
treated as a good thing. Deregulation means less bureaucratic 
meddling, and fewer rules and regulations stifling innovation 
and commerce. This usage puts those on the left-hand side of 
the political spectrum in an awkward position, since opposing 
deregulation-even, pointing out that it was an orgy of this very 
"deregulation" that led to the banking crisis of 2008-seems to 
imply a desire for more rules and regulations, and therefore, 
more gray men in suits standing in the way of freedom and 
innovation and generally telling people what to do. 
But this debate is based on false premises. Let's go back to 
banks. There's no such thing as an "unregulated" bank. Nor 
could there be. Banks are institutions to which the government 
has granted the power to create money-or, to be slightly more 
technical about it, the right to issue IOUs that the govern­
ment will recognize as legal tender, and, therefore, accept in 
payment of taxes and to discharge other debts within its own 
national terr itory. Obviously no government is about to grant 
anyone-least of all a profit-seeking firm-the power to cre­
ate as much money as they like under any circumstances. That 
would be insane. The power to create money is one that, by 
definition, governments can only grant under carefully circum­
scribed (read: regulated) conditions. And indeed this is what 
we always find: government regulates everything from a bank's 
reserve requirements to its hours of operation; how much it 
can charge in interest, fees, and penalties; what sort of secu­
rity precautions it can or must employ; how its records must 
be kept and reported; how and when it must inform its cli-
16 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
ents of their rights and responsibilities; and pretty much every-
thing else.

So what are people actually referring to when they talk 
about "deregulation"? In ordinary usage, the word seems to 
mean "changing the regulatory structure in a way .that I like." 
In practice this can refer to almost any thing. In the case of 
airlines or telecommunications in the seventies and eighties, it 
meant changing the system of regulation from one that encour­
aged a few large firms to one that fostered carefully supervised 
competition between midsize firms. In the case ofbanking, 
"deregulation" has usually meant exactly the opposite: moving 
away from a situation of managed competition between mid­
sized firms to one where a handful of financial conglomerates 
are allowed to completely dominate the market. This is what 
makes the term so handy. Simply by labeling a new regulatory 
measure "deregulation;' you can frame it in the public mind as 
a way to reduce bureaucracy and set individual initiative free, 
even if the result is a fivefold increase in the actual number of 
forms to be filled in, reports to be filed, rules and regulations 
for lawyers to interpret, and officious people in offices whose 
entire job seems to be to provide convoluted explanations for 
why you're not allowed to do thing s." 
This process-the gradual fusion of public and private power 
into a single entity, rife with rules and regulations whose ulti­
mate purpose is to extract wealth in the form of profits-does 
not yet have a name. That in itself is significant. These things 
can happen largely because we lack a way to talk about them. 
But one can see its effects in every aspect of our lives. It fills our 
days with paperwork. Application forms get longer and more 
elaborate. Ordinary documents like bills or tickets or member­
ships in sports or book clubs come to be buttressed by pages of 
legalistic fine print. 
17 The Utopia of Rules 
I'm going to make up a name. I'm going to call this the 
age of "total bureaucratization." (I was tempted to call this 
the age of"predatory bureaucratization" but it's really the all­
encompassing nature of the beast I want to highlight here.) 
It had its first stirrings, one might say, just at the point where 
public discussion of bureaucracy began to fall off in the late 
seventies, and it began to get seriously under way in the eight­
ies. But it truly took off in the nineties. 
In an earlier book, I suggested that the fundamental historical 
break that ushered in our current economic regime occurred 
in r97r, the date that the U.S. dollar went off the gold stan­
dard. This is what paved the way first for the financialization of 
capitalism, but ultimately, for much more profound long-term 
changes that I suspect will ultimately spell the end of capitalism 
entirely. I still think that. But here we are speaking of much 
more short-term effects.What did financialization mean for the 
deeply bureaucratized society that was postwar America?" 
I think what happened is best considered as a kind of shift 
in class allegiances on the part of the managerial staff of major 
corporations, from an uneasy, de facto alliance with their own 
workers, to one with investors.As John Kenneth Galbraith long 
ago pointed out, if you create an organization geared to produce 
perfumes, dairy products, or aircraft fuselages, those who make 
it up will, ifleft to their own devices, tend to concentrate their 
efforts on producing more and better perfumes, dairy products, 
or aircraft fuselages, rather than thinking primarily of what will 
make the most money for the shareholders. What' s more, since 
for most of the twentieth century, a job in a large bureaucratic 
mega-firm meant a lifetime promise of employment, everyone 
involved in the process-managers and workers alike-tended 
to see themselves as sharing a certain common interest in this 
regard, over and against meddling owners and investors. This 
kind of solidarity across class lines ·even had a name: it was 
called "corporatism." One mustn't romanticize it. It was among 
18 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
other things the philosophical basis of fascism. Indeed, one 
could well argue that fascism simply took the idea that workers 
and managers had common interests, that organizations like 
corporations or communities formed organic wholes, and that 
financiers were an alien, parasitical force, and drove them to 
their ultimate, murderous extreme. Even in its more benign 
social democratic versions, in Europe or America, the attendant 
politics often came tinged with chauvinism 18-but they also 
ensured that the investor class was always seen as to some extent 
outsiders, against whom white-collar and blue-collar workers 
could be considered, at least to some degree, to be united in a 
common front. 
From the perspective of sixties radicals, who regularly 
watched antiwar demonstrations attacked by nationalist team­
sters and construction workers, the reactionary implications of 
corporatism appeared self-evident. The corporate suits and the 
well-paid, Archie Bunker elements of the industrial proletariat 
were clearly on the same side. Unsurprising then that the left­
wing critique of bureaucracy at the time focused on the ways 
that social democracy had more· in common with fascism than 
its proponents cared to admit. Unsurprising, too, that this cri­
tique seems utterly irrelevant today.19 
What began to happen in the seventies, and paved the way 
for what we see today, was a kind of strategic pivot of the 
upper echelons of U.S. corporate bureaucracy-away from 
the workers, and towards shareholders, and eventually, towards 
the financial structure as a whole. The mergers and acquisi­
tions, corporate raiding, junk bonds, and asset stripping that 
began under Reagan and Thatcher and culminated in the rise 
of private equity firms were merely some of the more dramatic 
early mechanisms through which this shift of allegiance worked 
itself out. In fact, there was a double movement: corporate man­
agement became more financialized, but at the same time, the 
financial sector became corporatized, with investment banks, 
19 The Utopia of Rules 
hedge funds, and the like largely replacing individual investors. 
As a result the investor class and the executive class became 
almost indistinguishable. (Think here of the term "financial 
management;' which came to refer simultaneously to how the 
highest ranks of the corporate bureaucracy ran their firms, and 
how investors managed their portfolios.) Before long, heroic 
CEOs were being lionized in the media, their success largely 
measured by the number of employees they could fire. By the 
nineties, lifetime employment, even for white-collar ·workers, 
had become a thing of the past. When corporations wished to 
win loyalty, they increasingly did it by paying their employees 
in stock options. 20 
At the same time, the new credo was that everyone should 
look at the world through the eyes of an investor-that's why, in 
the eighties, newspapers began firing their labor reporters, but 
ordinary TV news reports came to be accompanied by crawls 
at the bottom of the screen displaying the latest stock quotes. 
The common cant was that through participation in personal 
retirement funds and investment funds of one sort or another, 
everyone would come to own a piece of capitalism. In reality; 
the magic circle was only really widened to include the higher 
paid professionals and the corporate bureaucrats themselves. 
Still, that extension was extremely important. No political 
revolution can succeed without allies, and bringing along acer­
tain portion of the middle class --an d, even more crucially, con­
vincing the bulk of the middle classes that they had some kind 
of stake in finance-driven capitalism-was critical. Ultimately, 
the more liberal members of this professional-managerial elite 
became the social base for what came to pass as "left-wing" 
political parties, as actual working-class organizations like 
trade unions were cast into the wilderness. (Hence, the U.S. 
Democratic Party , or New Labour in Great Britain, whose 
leaders engage in regular ritual acts of public abjuration of the 
very unions that have historically formed their strongest base 
20 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
of suppo rt). These were of course people who already tended 
to work in thoroughly bureaucratized environments, whether 
schools, hospitals, or corporate law firms. The actual working 
class, who bore a traditional loathing for such characters, either 
dropped out of politics entirely, or were increasingly reduced to 
casting protest votes for the radical Right. 21 
This was not just a political realignment. It was a cultural 
transformation.And it set the stage for the process whereby the 
bureaucratic techniques (performance reviews, focus groups, 
time alloc ation surveys ... ) developed in financial and corporate 
circles came to invade the rest of society-education, science, 
government-and eventually, to pervade almost every aspect of 
every day life. One can best trace the process, perhaps, by fol­
lowing its language. There is a peculiar idiom that first emerged 
in such circles, full of bright, empty terms like vision, quality, 
stakeholder, leadership, excellence, innovation, strategic goals, 
or best practices. (Much of it traces back to "self-actualization" 
movements like Lifespring, Mind Dynamics, and EST, which 
were extremely popular in corporate boardrooms in the seven­
ties, but it quickly became a language unto itself.) Now, imagine 
it would be possible to create a map of some major city, and then 
place one tiny blue dot on the location of every document that 
uses at least three of these words. Then imagine' that we could 
watch it change over time. We would be able to observe this 
new corporate bureaucratic culture spread like blue stains in a 
petri dish, starting in the financial districts, on to boardrooms, 
then government offices and universities, then, finally, engulfing 
any location where any number of people gather to discuss the 
allocation of resources of any kind at all. 
For all its celebration of markets and individual initiative, this 
alliance of government and finance often produces results · 
that bear a striking resemblance to the worst excesses of 
21 The Utopia of Rules 
bureaucratization in the former Soviet Union or former colo­
nial backwaters of the Global South. There is a rich anthropo­
logical literature, for instance, on the cult of certificates, licenses, 
and diplomas in the former colonial world. Often the argument 
is that in countries like Bangladesh, Trinidad, or Cameroon, 
which hover between the stifling legacy of colonial domination 
and their own magical traditions, official credentials are seen as 
a kind of mater ial fetish-magical objects conveying power in 
their own right, entirely apart from the real knowledge, experi­
ence, or training they're supposed· to represent. But since the 
eighties, the real explosion of credentialism has been in what 
are supposedly the most "advanced" economies, like the United 
States, Great Britai �, or Canada. As one anthropologist, Sarah 
Kendzior, puts it: 
22 "The United States has become the most rigidly cre­
dentialised society in the world;' write James Engel! 
and Anthony Dangerfield in their 2005 book Savin g 
Higher Education in the Age ef Money. "A BA is required 
for jobs that by no stretch of imagination need two 
years of full-time training, let alone four." 
The promotion of college as a requirement for a 
middle-class life ... has resulted in the exclusion of the 
non-college educated from professions of public influ­
ence. In 1971, 58 percent of journalists had a college 
degree. Today, 92 percent do, and at many publications, 
a graduate degree in journalism is required-despite 
the fact that most renowned journalists have never 
studied journalism. 22 
Journalism is one of many fields of public influ­
ence-including politics-in which credentials func­
tion as de facto permission to speak, rendering those 
who lack them less likely to be employed and less able 
to afford to stay in their field. Ability is. discounted The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
without credentials, but the ability to purchase creden­
tials rests, more often than not, on family wealth.23 
One could repeat the story in field after field, from nurses 
to art teachers, physical therapists to foreign policy consultants. 
Almost every endeavor that used to be considered an art (best 
learned through doing) now requires formal professional train­
ing and a certificate of completion, and this seems to be hap­
pening, equally, in both the private and public sectors, since, 
as already noted, in matters bureaucratic, such distinctions are 
becoming effectively meaningless. While these measures are 
touted-as are all bureaucratic measures--'15 a way of creating 
fair, impersonal mechanisms in fields previously dominated by 
insider knowledge and social connections, the effect is often the 
opposite. As anyone who has been to graduate school knows, 
it's precisely the children of the professional-managerial classes, 
those whose family resources make them the least in need of 
financial support, who best know ho� to navigate the world of 
paperwork that enables them to get said support.24 For every­
one else, the main result of one's years of professional training is 
to ensure that one is saddled with such an enormous burden of 
student debt that a substantial chunk of any subsequent income 
one will get from pursuing that profession will henceforth 
be siphoned off, each month, by the financial sector. In some 
cases, these new training requirements can only be described as 
outright scams, as when lenders, and those prepared to set up 
the training programs, jointly lobby the government to insist 
that, say, all pharmacists be henceforth required to pass some 
additional qualifying examination, forcing thousands already 
practicing the· profession into night school, which these phar­
macists know many will only be able to afford with the help of 
high-interest student loans.25 By doing this, lenders are in effect 
legislating themselves a cut of most pharmacists' subsequent 
incomes.26 
23 The Utopia of Rules 
The latter might seem an extreme case, but in its own way it's 
paradigmatic of the fusion of public and private power under the 
new financial regime. Increasin gly, corporate profits in America 
are not derived from commerce or industry at all, but from 
finance-which means, ultimate ly, from other people's debts. 
These debts do not just happen by accident. To a large degree, 
they are engineered---{lnd by precisely this kind of fusion of 
public and private power. The corporatization of education; 
the resulting ballooning of tuitions as students are expected 
to pay for giant football stadiums and similar pet projects of 
executive trustees, or to contribute to the burgeoning salaries of 
ever-multiplying university officials; the increasing demands for 
degrees as certificates of entry into any job that promises access 
to anything like a middle-class standard of living; resulting ris­
ing levels of indebtedness� these form a single web. One 
result of all this debt is to render the government itself the main 
mechanism for the extraction of corporate profits. (Just think, 
here, of what happens if one tries to default on one's student 
loans: the entire legal apparatus leaps into action, threatening 
to seize assets, garnish wages, and apply thousands of dollars 
in additional penalties.) Another is to force the debtors them­
selves to bureaucratize ever-increasing dimensions of their own 
lives, which have to be managed as if they were themselves a 
tiny corporation measuring inputs and outputs and constantly 
struggling to balance its accounts. 
It's also important to emphasize that while this system of 
extraction comes dressed up in a language of rules and regula­
tions, in its actual mode of operation, it has almost nothing 
to do with ,the rule of law. Rather, the legal system has itself 
become the means for a system ofincreasingly arbitrary extrac­
tions. As -the profits from banks and credit card companies 
derive more and more from "fees and penalties" levied on their 
customers-so much so that those living check to check can 
regularly expect to be charged eighty dollars for a five-dollar 
24 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
overdr aft-financial firms have come to play by an entirely dif­
ferent set of rules. I once attended a conference on the crisis in 
the banking system where I was able to have a brief, informal 
chat with an economist for one of the Bretton Woods institu­
tions (probably best I not say which). I asked him why everyone 
was still waiting for even one bank official to be brought to trial 
for any act of fraud leading up to the crash of 2008. 
OFFICIAL: Well, you have to understand the approach 
taken by U.S. prosecutors to financial fraud is always to 
negotiate a settlement. They don't want to have to go to 
trial. The upshot is always that the financial institution 
has to pay a fine, sometimes in the hundreds of millions, 
but they don't actually admit to any criminal liability . 
Their lawyers simply say they are not going to contest 
the charge, but if they pay, they haven't technically been 
found guilty of anything. 
ME: So you're saying if the govermnent discovers that 
Goldman Sachs, for instance, or Bank of America, has 
committed fraud, they effectively just charge them a 
penalty fee. 
OFFICIAL:That's right. 
ME: So in that case ... okay, I guess the real question is 
this: has there ever been a case where the amount the 
firm had to pay was more than the amount of money 
they made from the fraud itself? 
OFFICIAL: Oh no, not to my knowledge.· Usually it's 
substantially less. 
ME: So what are we talking here, 50 percent? 
25 The Utopia of Rules 
OFFICIAL: I'd say more like 20 to 30 percent on average. 
But it varies considerably case by case. 
ME: Which means ... correct me if I'm wrong, but 
doesn't that effectively mean the government is saying, 
"you can commit all the fraud you like, but if we catch 
you, you're going to have to give us our cut"? 
OFFICIAL: Well, obviously I can't put it that way myself as 
long as I have this job ... 
And of course, the power of those same banks to charge 
account-holders eighty bucks for an overdraft is enforced by 
the same court system content to merely collect a piece of the 
action when the bank itself commits fraud. 
Now, on one level, this might just seem like another example 
of a familiar story: the rich always play by a different set of rules. 
If the children of bankers can regularly get off the hook for 
carrying quantities of cocaine that would almost certainly have 
earned them decades in a federal penitentiary if they happened 
to be poor or Black, why should things be any different when 
they grow up to become bankers themselves? But I think there 
is something deeper going on here, and it turns on the very 
nature of bureaucratic systems. Such institutions always create a 
culture of complicity. It's not just that some people get to break 
the rules-it's that loyalty to the 0rganization is to some degree 
measured by one's willingness to pretend this isn't happening. 
And insofar as bureaucratic logic is extended to the society as a 
whole, all of us start playing along. 
This point is worth expanding on. What I am saying is that 
we are not just looking at a double standard, but a particular 
kind of double standard typical of bureaucratic systems every­
where. All bureaucracies are to a certain degree utopian, in the 
sense that they propose an abstract ideal that real human beings 
26 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
can never live up to. Take the initial point about credential­
ism. Sociologists since We ber always note that it is one of the 
defining features of any bureaucracy that those who staff it are 
selected by formal, impersonal criteria-most often, some kind 
of written test. (That is, bureaucrats are not, say, elected like 
politicians, but neither should they get the job just because 
they are someone's cousin.) In theory they are meritocracies. In 
fact everyo ne knows the system is compromised in a thousand 
different ways .. Many of the staff are in fact there just because 
they are someone's cousin, and everybody knows it. The first 
criterion of loyalty to the organization becomes complicit y. 
Career advancement is not based on merit, and not even based 
necessarily on being someone's cousin; above all, it's based on a 
willingness to play along with the fiction that career advance­
ment is based on merit, even though everyo ne knows this not 
to be true. 27 Or with the fiction that rules and regulations apply 
to every one equ ally, when, in fact, they are often deployed as a 
means for entirely arbitrary personal power. 
This is how bureaucracies have always tended to work. 
But for most of history , this fact has only been important for 
those who actually operated within admini strative systems: say, 
aspiring Confucian scholars in Medieval China. Most everyone 
else didn't really have to think about organizations very often; 
typica lly, they only encountered them every few years when 
it came time to register their fields and cattle for the local tax 
authorities. But as I've pointed out, the last two centuries have 
seen an explosion of bureaucr acy, and the last thirty or forty 
years in particular have seen bureaucratic principles extended 
to every aspect of our existence.As a result, this culture of com­
plicity has come to spread as well. Many of us actually act as if 
we believe that the courts really are treating the financial estab­
lishment as it should be treated, that they are even dealing with 
them too harshly; and that ordinary citizens really do deserve 
to be penalized a hundred times more harshly for an overdraft. 
27 The Utopia of Rules 
As whole societies have come to represent themselves as giant 
credentialized meritocracies, rather than systems of arbitrary 
extraction, everyone duly scurries about trying to curry favor 
by pretending they actually believe this is to be true. 
So: what would a left-wing critique of total, or predatory , bu­
reaucratization look like? 
I think the story of the Glo balJustice Movement provides a 
hint- because it was a movement that, rather to its own surprise, 
discovered this was what it was about. I remember this quite 
well because I was deeply involved in the movement at the time. 
Back in the 1990s, "globalizat ion;' as touted by jour nalists like 
Thomas Friedman (but really, by the entire journalistic establish­
ment in the United States and most of it in other wealthy coun­
tries) was portrayed as an almost natural force. Technological 
advances-particularly the Intern et-were knitting the world 
together as never before, increased communication was leading 
to increased trade, and national borders were rapidly becoming 
irrelevant as free trade treaties united the globe into a single 
world marke t. In political debates of the time in the mainstream 
media, all of this was discussed as such a self-evident reality that 
anyo ne who objected to the process could be treated as if they 
were object ing to basic laws of nature-they were flat-earthers, 
buff oons, the left-wing equivalents of Biblical fundamentalists 
who thought evolution was a hoax. 
Thus when the Global Justice Movement started, the media 
spin was that it was a rearguard action of hoar y, carbuncular 
leftists who wished to restore protectionism, national sover­
eignty, barriers to trade and communication, and, general ly, to 
vainly stand against the Inevitable Tide of History. The problem 
with this was that it was obviously untrue. Most immediatel y, 
there was the fact that the protestors' average age, especially in 
the wealthier countries, seemed to be about nineteen. More 
28 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
serious ly, there was the fact that the movement was a form of 
globalization in itself: a kaleidoscopic alliance of people from 
every corner of the world, including organizations ranging from 
Indian farmers' associations, to the Canadian postal workers' 
union, to indigenous groups in Panama, to anarchist collect ives 
in Detroit. What's more, its exponents endlessly insisted that 
despite protestations to the cont rary, what the media was calling 
"globalization" had almost nothing to do with the effacement 
of borders and the free movement of people, products, and 
ideas. It was really about trapping increasingly large parts of the 
world's population behind highly militarized national borders 
within which social protections could be systematically with­
drawn, creating a pool ofla borers so desperate that they would 
be willing to work for almost nothi ng. Against it, they proposed 
a genuinely borderless world. 
Obviou sly, these ideas' exponents did not get to say any of 
this on TV or major newspapers-at least not in countries like 
America, whose media is strictly policed by its own internal 
corporate bureaucrats. Such arguments were, eff ectively, taboo. 
But we discovered that there was something we could do that 
worked almost as well. We could besiege the summits where 
the trade pacts were negotiated and the annual meetings of 
the institutions through which the terms of what was called 
globalization were actually concocted, encoded, and enforced. 
Until the movement came to North America with the siege of 
the Wo rld Trade Meeting in Seattle in November 1999-and 
subsequent blockades against the IMF/W orld Bank Meetings 
in Washington-most Americans simply had no idea that any 
of these organizations even existed. The actions operated like a 
magic charm that exposed everything that was supposed to be 
hidden: all we had to do was show up and try to block access 
to the venue, and instantly we reve aled the existence of a vast 
global bureaucracy of interlocking organizations that nobody 
was supposed to really think about. And of course, at the same 
29 The Utopia of Rules 
time, we would mag ically whisk into existence thousands 
of heavily armed riot police ready to reveal just what those 
bureaucrats were willing to unleash against anyone-no matter 
how nonviolent-who tried to stand in their way. 
It was a surpr isingly effective strategy. Within a matter of 
two or three years, we had sunk pretty much every proposed 
new global trade pact, and institutions like the IMF had been 
effectively expelled from Asia, Latin America, and, indeed, most 
of the world's surface.28 
The imagery worked because it showed everything people 
had been told about globalization to be a lie. This was not some 
natural process of peaceful trade, made possible by new tech­
nologies. What was being talked about in terms of"free trade" 
and the "free market" really entailed the self-conscious comple­
tion of the world's first effective" planetary-scale administrative 
bureaucratic system. The foundations for the system had been 
laid in the 1940s, but it was only with the waning of the Cold 
War that they became truly effective. In the process, they came 
to be made up-like most other bureaucratic systems being 
created on a smaller scale at the same time-of such a thorough 
entanglement of public and private elements that it was often 
quite impossible to pull them apart-even conceptually. Let us 
think about it .this way: At the top were the trade bureaucra­
cies like the IMF, Wo rld Bank, WTO and the G8s, along with 
treaty organizations like NAFTA or the EU. These actually 
developed the economic-and even social-policies followed 
by supposedly democratic governments in the global south. 
Just below were the large global financial firms like Gold­
man Sachs, Lehman Brothers, American Insurance Group, or, 
for that matter, institutions like Standard & Poors. Below that 
came the transnational mega-corporations. (Much of what was 
being called "international trade" in fact consisted merely of the 
transfer of materials back and forth between different branches 
of the same corporation.) Final ly, one has to include the NGOs, 
30 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
which in many parts of the world come to provide many of the 
social services previously provided by government, with the 
result that urban planning in a city in Nepal, or health policy in 
a rown in Nigeria, might well have been dev eloped in offices in 
Zurich or Chicago. 
At the time, we didn't talk about things in quite these 
terms-that "free trade" and "the free market" actually meant 
the creation of global administrative structures mainly aimed at 
ensuring the extrac tion of profits for inve stors, that "globaliza­
tion" really meant bureaucrati zation. We often came close. But 
we rarely quite out and said it. 
In retro spect, I think this is exactly what we should have 
emphasized. Even the emphasis on inventing new forms of 
democratic processes that was at the core of the movement­
the assemb lies, the spokescouncils, and so on-w as, more than 
anything else, a way to show that people could indeed get on 
with one another-and even make important decisions and 
carry out complex collect ive proj ects- without anyone ever 
having to fill out a form, appeal a judgment, or threaten to 
phone security or the police. 
The Global Justice Movement was, in its own way, the first 
major leftist antibureaucratic movement of the era of total 
bureaucratization. As such, I think it offers important lessons 
for anyone trying to develop a similar critique. Let me end by 
outlining three of them: 
1. Do not under estimate the importance of 
sheer physical violence. 
The armies of highly milita rized police that appeared to attack 
the summit protestors were not some sort of weird side effect 
of"g lobalizat ion!' Whenever someone starts talking about the 
"free mark et;' it's a good idea to look around for the man with 
the gun. He's never far away. Free-market liberalism of the 
31 The Utopia of Rules 
nineteenth century corresponded with the invention of the 
modern police and private detect ive agencies,3° and gradual ly, 
with the notion that those police had at least ultimate jurisdic­
tion over virtually every aspect of urban life, from the regula­
tion of street peddlers to noise levels at private parties, or even 
to the resolution of bitter fights with crazy uncles or college 
roommates. We are now so used to the idea that we at least could 
call the poli�e to resolve virtually any difficult circumstance that 
many of us find it difficult to even imagine what people would 
have done before this was possible.31 Because, in fact, for the 
vast majority of people throughout history-even those who 
lived in in large cities-there were simply no authorities to call 
in such circumsta nces. Or, at least, no impersonal bureaucratic 
ones who were, like the modern police, empowered to impose 
arbitrary resolutions backed by the threat of force. 
Here I think it is possible to add a kind of corollary to the 
Iron Law of Liberalism. History reveals that political policies 
that favor "the market" have always meant even more people 
in offices to administer things, but it also reveals that they also 
mean an increase of the range and density of social relations that 
are ultimately regulated by the threat of violence. This obvi­
ously flies in the face of everything we've been taught to believe 
about the market, but if you observe what actually happens, it's 
clearly ttue. In a sense, even calling this a "cor ollary" is decep­
tive, because we're really just talking about two different ways 
of talking about the same thing. The bureaucratization of daily 
life means the imposition of impersonal rules and regulations; 
impersonal rules and regulati ons, in turn, can only operate if 
they are backed up by the threat of force. i2 And indeed, in this 
most recent phase of total bureaucratization, we've seen security 
cameras, police scooters, issuers of temporary ID cards, and men 
and women in a variety of uniforms acting in either public or 
private capacities, trained in tactics of menacing, intimidating, 
and ultimately deploying physical violence, appear just about 
32 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bur eaucratization 
every where-even in places such as playgrounds, primary 
schools, college campuses, hospitals, libraries, parks, or beach 
resorts, where fifty years ago their presence would have been 
considered scandalous, or simply weird. 
All this takes place as social theorists continue to insist 
that the direct appeal to force plays less and less of a factor in 
maintaining structures of social control." The more reports one 
reads, in fact, of university students being tasered for unauthor­
ized library use, or English prof essors being jailed and charged 
with felonies after being caught jaywalking on campus, the 
louder the defiant insistence that the kinds of subtle symbolic 
power analyzed by English professors are what's really impor­
tant. It begins to sound more and more like a desperate refusal 
to accept that the workings of power could really be so· crude 
and simplistic as what daily evidence proves them to be. 
In my own native New York, I have observed the endless 
multiplication of bank branches.When I was growing up, most 
bank offices were large, freestanding buildings, usually designed 
to look like Greek or Roman temples. Over the last thirty years, 
storefront branches of the same three or four megabanks have 
opened, it seems, on every third block in the more prosperous 
parts of Manhattan. In the greater New York area there are now 
literally thousands of them, each one having replaced some 
earlier shop that once provided material goods and services of 
one sort or another. In a way these are the perfect symbols of 
our age: stores selling pure abstr action-immaculate boxes con­
taining little but glass and steel dividers, computer screens, and 
armed securi ty. They define the perf ect point of con juncture 
between guns and information, since that's really all that's there. 
And that conjuncture has come to provide the framework for 
almost every other aspect of our lives. 
When we think about such matters at all, we generally act 
as if this is all simply an effect of technology: this is a world 
whisked into being by computers. It even looks like one. And 
33 The Utopia of Rules 
indeed, all these new bank lob bi es do bear a striking resem­
blance to the stripp ed-down virtnal reality one often found in 
r99os video games. It's as if we have finally achieved the ability 
to make such virtual realities materialize, and in so doing, to 
' reduce our lives, too, to a kind of video game, as we negotiate 
the various mazeways of the new bureaucracies. Since, in such 
video games, nothing is actually produced, it just kind of springs 
into being, and we really do spend our lives earning points and 
dodging people carrying weapons. 
But this sense that we are living in a world created by com­
puters is itself an illusion. To conclude that this was all an inevi­
table effect of technological development, rather than of social 
and political forces, would be making a terrible mistake. Here 
too the lessons of"globalization;' which was supposed to have 
been somehow created by the Internet, are critically important: 
2. Do not overestimate the importance of technology as a 
causative factor. 
Just as what came to be called "globalization" was really a cre­
ation of new political alignments, policy decisions, and new 
bureaucraci es- which were only later followed by physical 
technologies like containerized shipping, or the Internet--so 
the per vasive bureaucratization of everyday life made pos­
sible by the computers is not, itself, the result of technological 
development. Rather it's the other way around. Technological 
change is simply not an independent variable. Technology will 
advance, and often in surpri sing and unexpected ways . But the 
overall direction it takes depends on social factors. 
This is easy to forget because our immediate experience of 
everyday bureaucratization is entirely caught up in new infor­
mation technologies: Face book, smartphone banking, Amazon, 
PayP al, endless handheld devices that reduce the world around 
us to maps, forms, codes, and graphs. Still, the key alignments 
that made all this possible are precisely those that I have been 
34 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
describing in this essay, that first took place in the seventies and 
eighties, with the alliance of finance and corporate bureaucrats, 
the new corporate culture that emerged from it, and its abil­
ity to invade educational, scientific, and government circles in 
such a way that public and private bureaucracies finally merged 
together in a mass of paperwork designed to facilitate the direct 
extraction of wealth. This was not a product of new technolo­
gies. To the contrary, the appropriate technologies took decades 
to emerge. In the seventies, computers were still something of 
a joke. Banks and government offices were keen on putting 
them into service, but for most of those on the receiving end, 
they were the very definition of bureaucratic idiocy; when­
ever something went terribly, obviously wrong, the reaction 
was alway s to throw up one's eyes and blame "some computer." 
After forty years and the endless investment of research fund­
ing into information technologies, we have gotten to the point 
where the kinds of computers bankers employ, and provide, are 
our very definition of infallible, magical efficiency. 
Consider the ATM machine. In the last thirty years, I can't 
remember a single occasion in which I have asked an ATM 
machine for money and gotten an incorrect amount. Nor have 
I been able to find anyone I know who can. This is so true that 
in the wake of the 2000 U.S. presidential elections, when the 
public was being regaled with statistics on the 2.8 percent degree 
of error expected from this type of voting machine, or the r.5 
percent expected from that, some had the temerity to point 
out that in a country that defines itself as the world's greatest 
democracy, where elections are our very sacrament, we seem 
to just accept that voting machines will regularly miscount the 
vote, while every day hundreds of millions of ATM transactions 
take place with an overall zero percent rate of error. Wh at does 
this say about what really matters to Americans as a nation? 
Financial technology then has gone from a running gag to 
something so reliable that it can form the assumed backbone 
of our social reality .You never have to think about whether the 
35 The Utopia of Rules 
cash machine will dispense the correct amount of cash. If it's 
working at all, it will not make a mistake. This gives financial 
abstractions an air of utter certainty-a "ready-to-hand" qual­
ity, as Martin Heidegger put it---cSuch an essential part of the 
practical infrastructure of our daily projects and affairs that we 
never have to think about as something in itself at all. Mean­
while physical infrastructure like roads, escalators, bridges, and 
underground railw ays crumbles around us, and the landscape 
surrounding major cities is peppered with the futuristic visions 
of past generations now lying smelly, dirty , or abandoned. 
None of this just happened. It is, precisely, a matter of national 
priorities: the result of policy decisions that allocate funding 
for every thing from landmark preservation to certain kinds of 
scientific research. This is the world that all those endless docu­
ments about "vision," "quality ," "leadershi p," and "innovation" 
have actually produced. Rather than causing our current situa­
tion, the direction that technological change has taken is itself 
largely a function of the power of finance. 
3. Always remember it's all ultimately about value 
(or: whenever you hear someone say that what their 
greatest value is rational ity, they are just sayi ng that 
because they don't want to admit to what their greatest 
value really is). 
The "self-actualization" philosophy from which most of this 
new bureaucratic language emerged insists that we live in a 
timeless present, that history means nothing, that we simply 
create the world around us through the power of the will. This 
is a kind of individualistic fascism. Around the time the phi­
losophy became popular in the seventies, some conservative 
Christian theologians were actually thinking along very similar 
lines: seeing electronic money as a kind of extension for God's 
creative power, which is then transformed into material reality, 
36 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bur eaucratization 
through the minds of inspired entrep reneurs. It's easy to see 
how this could lead to the creation of a world where financial 
abstractions feel like the very bedrock of reality, and so many 
of our lived environments look like they were 3-D- printed 
from somebod y's computer screen. In fact, the sense of a digi­
tally generated world I've been describing could be taken as 
a perf ect illustration of another social law -at least, it seems 
to me that it should be recognized as a law-th at, if one gives 
sufficient social power to a class of people holding even the 
most outlandish ideas, they will, consciously or not, eventually 
contrive to produce a world organ ized in such a way that living 
in it will, in a thousand subtle ways , reinforce the impression 
that those ideas are self-evidently true. 
In the north Atlantic countries, all this is the culmination 
of a very long effort to transform popular ideas about the ori­
gins of value. Most Americans, for insta nce, used to subscribe 
to a rough-and-ready version of the labor theory of value. It 
made intuitive sense in a world where most people were farm­
ers, mechanics, or shopkeepers: the good things in lif e were 
assumed to exist because people took the trouble to produce 
them; doing so was seen as involving both brain and muscle, 
usually, in roughly equal proportions. In the mid-nineteenth 
century even mainstream politicians would often use language 
that might seem to have been taken straight from Karl Marx. So 
Abraham Lincoln: 
Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital 
is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed 
if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of 
capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. 34 
The rise of bureaucratic capitalism in the Gilded Age was 
accompanied by a self-conscious effort, on the part of the new 
tycoons of the day, to put this kind of language aside, and to 
37 The Utopia of Rules 
promulgate what was considered at the time the bold new phi­
losophy-steel magnate Andrew Carnegie spoke of it as "The 
Gospel ofW ealth"-that value was instead derived from capital 
itself. Carnegie and his allies embarked on a well-funded cam­
paign of promoting the new gospel, not just in Rotary Clubs 
and Chambers of Commerce across the nation, but also in 
schools, churches, and civic associations ." The basic argument 
was that the very efficiency of the new giant firms these men 
directed could produce such a material botinty it would allow 
Americans to realize themselves through what they consumed 
rather than what they produced. In this view, value was ulti­
mately a product of the very bureaucratic organization of the 
new conglomerates. 
One thing that the global justice movement taught us is that 
politics is, indeed, ultimately about value; but also, that those 
creating vast bureaucratic systems will almost never admit what 
their values really are. This was as true of the Carnegies as it 
is today. Nor mally, they will-like the robber barons of the 
turn of the last century-insist that they are acting in the name 
of efficiency, or "rationality ." But in fact this language always 
turns out to be intentionally vague, even nonsens ical. The term 
"rationality" is an excellent case in point here.A "rational" per­
son is someone who is able to make basic logical connections 
and assess reality in a non-delusional fashion. In other words, 
someone who isn't crazy. Anyo ne who claims to base their 
politics on rationality ---mld this is true on the left as well as on 
the right-is claiming that anyone who disagrees with them 
might as well be insane, which is about as arrogant a position 
as one could possibly take. Or else, they're using "rationality" as 
a synonym for "technical efficiency," and thus focusing on how 
they are going about something because they do not wish to 
talk about what it is they are ultimately going about. Neoclassi­
cal economics is notorious for making this kind of move. When 
an economist attempts to prove that it is "irrational" to vote 
in national elections (because the eff ort expended outweighs 
38 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratiza tion 
the likely benefit to the individual voter) , they use the term 
because they do not wish to say "irrational for actors for whom 
civic participation, political ideals, or the common good are 
not values in themselve s, but who view public affairs only in 
terms of personal advantage." There is absolutely no reason why 
one could not rationally calculate the best way to further one's 
political ideals through voting. But according to the economists' 
assump tions, anyone who takes this course might as well be out 
of their minds. 
In other words, talking about rational efficiency becomes 
a way of avoiding talking about what the efficiency is actu­
ally for; that is, the ultimately irrational aims that are assumed 
to be the ultimate ends of human behavior. Here is another 
place where markets and bureaucracies ultimately speak the 
same language. Both claim to be acting largely in the name 
of individual freedom, and individual self-realization through 
consumption. Even supporters of the old_ Prussian bureaucratic 
state in the nineteenth century, like Hegel or Goethe, insisted 
that its authoritarian measures could be justified by the fact they 
allowed citizens to be absolutely secure in their property , and 
therefore, free to do absolutely anything they pleased in their 
own homes-whether that meant pursuing the arts, religion, 
romance, or philosophical speculation, or simply a matter of 
deciding for themselves what sort of beer they chose to drink, 
music they chose to listen to, or clothes they chose to wear. 
Bureaucratic capitalism, when it appeared in the _United States, 
similarly justified itself on consumerist grounds: one could 
justify demanding that workers abandon any control over the 
conditions under which they worked if one could thus guar­
antee them a wider and cheaper range of products for them 
to use at home. 36 There was always assumed to be a synergy 
between impersonal, rule-bound organization- whether in 
the public sphere, or the sphere of production-and absolute 
free self-expression in the club, cafe, kitchen, or family outing. 
(At first, of course, this freedom was limited to male heads of 
39 The Utopia of Rules 
household; over time, it was at least in principle extended to 
everyo ne.) 
The most profound legacy of the dominance of bureaucratic 
forms of organization over the last two hundred years is that 
it has made this intuitive division between rational, technical 
means and the ultimately irrational ends to which they are put 
seem like common sense. This is true on the national level, 
where civil servants pride themselves on being able to find the 
most efficient means to pursue whatever national destiny their 
country's rulers happen to dream up: whether that be rooted in 
the pursuit of cultural brilliance, imperial conquest, the pursuit 
of a genuinely egalitarian social order, or the literal application 
of Biblical law. It is equally true on the individual level, where 
we all take for granted that human beings go out into the mar­
ketplace merely to calculate the most efficient way to enrich 
themselve s, but that once they have the money, there's no tell­
ing what they might decide to do with it: whether it be to buy 
a mansi on, or a race car, engage in a personal inve stigation of 
UFO disappearances, or simply lavish the money on one's kids . 
It all seems so self-evident that it's hard for us to remember that 
in most human societies that have existed, historica lly, such a 
division would make no sense at all. In most times and places, 
the way one goes about doing something is assumed to be 
the ultimate expression of who one is. 37 But it also seems as 
if the moment one divides the world into two spheres in this 
way-i nto the domain of sheer technical competence and a 
separate domain of ultimate values-each sphere will inevi­
tably begin trying to invade the other. Some will declare that 
rationa lity, or even efficiency , are themselves valu es, that they 
are even ultimate values, and that we should somehow create a 
"rational" society (whatever that means) . Others will insist that 
life should become art; or else, religi on. But all such movements 
are premised on the very division they profess to overcome. 
In the big picture it hardly matters, then, whether one seeks 
40 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratization 
to reorganize the world around bureaucratic efficiency or 
market rationalit y: all the fundamental assumptions remain the 
same. This helps explain why it's so easy to move back and forth 
between them, as with those ex- Soviet officials who so cheer­
fully switched hats from endorsing total state control of the 
economy, to total marketization-and in the process, true to the 
Iron Law, managed to increase the total number of bureaucrats 
employed in their country dramatically." Or how the two can 
fuse into an almost seamless whole, as in the current era of total 
bureaucratization. 
For anyone who has ever been a refugee, or for that matter 
had to fill out the forty-page application required to get one's 
daughter considered for admission by a London music school, 
the idea that bureaucracy has anything to do with rationality, let 
alone efficiency, might seem odd. But this is the way it looks 
from the top. In fact, from inside the system, the algorithms 
and mathematical formulae by which the world comes to be 
assessed become, ultimately, not just measures of value, but the 
source of value itself . " Much of what bureaucrats do, after all, 
is evaluate things. They are continually assessing, auditing, mea­
suring, weighing the relative merits of different plans, proposals, 
applications, courses of action, or candidates for promotion. 
Market reforms only reinforce this tendency. This happens on 
every level. It is felt most cruelly by the poor, who are constantly 
monitored by an intrusive army of moralistic box -tickers assess­
ing their child- rearing skills, inspecting their food cabinets to 
see if they are really cohabiting with their partners, determining 
whether they have been trying hard enough to find a job, or 
whether their medical conditions are really sufficiently severe 
to disqualify them from physical labor. All rich countries now 
employ legions of functionaries whose primary function is to 
make poor people feel bad about themselves. But the culrure 
of evaluation is if anything even more pervasive in the hyper­
credentialized world of the professional classes, where audit 
41 The Utopia of Rules 
culture reigns, and nothing is real that cannot be quantifi ed, 
tabu lated, or entered into some interface or quarterly report. 
Not only is this world ultimately a product of financ ialization, 
it's really just a continuation of it. Since what is the world of 
securitized derivativ es, collateralized debt obligations, and other 
such exotic financial instruments but the apotheosis of the prin­
ciple that value is ultimately a product of paperwork, and the 
very apex of a mountain of assessment forms which begins with 
the irritating caseworker determining whether you are really 
poor enough to merit a fee waiver for your children's medicine 
and ends with men in suits engaged in high- speed trading of 
bets over how long it will take you to default on your mortgage. 
A critique ofbureau�racy fit for the times would have to show 
how all these threads-f inancializati on, violence, technology , 
the fusipn of public and private-knit together into a single, self­
sustaining web. The process of financialization has meant that 
an ever-increasing proportion of corporate profits come in the 
form of rent extrac tion of one sort or another. Since this is ulti­
mately little more than legalized extortion, it is accompanied by 
ever-increasing accumulation of rules and regula tions, and ever­
more sophisticated, and omnipresent, threats of physical force to 
enforce them. Indeed they become so omnipresent that we no 
longer realize we're being threatened, since we cannot imagine 
what it would be like not to be. At the same time, some of the 
profits from rent extraction are recycled to select portions of the 
prof essional classes, or to create new cadres of paper-pushing 
corporate bureaucrats. This helps a phenomenon I have written 
about elsewh ere: the continual growth, in recent decades, of 
apparently meaningless, make-work, "bullshit jobs" ___,; trategic 
vision coordinators, human resources consultants, legal analysts, 
and the like-despite the fact that even those who hold such 
positions are half the time secretly convinced they contribute 
42 The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total Bureaucratiza tion 
nothing to the enterprise. In the end, this is just an extension of 
the basic logic of class realignment that began in the seventies 
and eighties as corporate bureaucracies become extensions of 
the financial system. 
Every now and then you chance on a particular example that 
brings everything together. In September 2013, I visited a tea 
factory outside Marseille that was currently being occupied by 
its workers. There had been a standoff with local police for over 
a year. What had brought things to such a pass? A middle-aged 
factory worker, who took me on a tour of the plant, explained 
that while ostensibly the issue was a decision to move the plant 
to Poland to take advantage of cheaper labor, the ultimate 
issue had to do with the allocation of profits. The oldest and 
most exp erienced of the hundred-odd workers there had spent 
years tinkering with, and improving, the efficiency of the giant 
machines used to package teabags. Output had increased and 
with them profits. Yet what did the owners do with the extra 
money? Did they give the workers a raise to reward them for 
increased productivity? In the old Keynesian days of the fifties 
and sixties they almost certainly would have. No longer. Did 
they hire more workers and expand production? No again. All 
they did was hire middle managers. 
For years, he explained, there had only been two executives 
in the factory: the boss, and a human resources officer.As profits 
rose, more and more men in suits appeared, until there were 
almost a dozen of them. The suits all had elaborate titles but 
there was almost nothing for them to do, so they spent a lot 
of time walking the catwalks staring at the workers, setting up 
metrics to measure and evaluate them, writing plans and reports. 
Eventuall y, they hit on the idea of moving the entire opera­
tion overseas-largely, he speculated, because devising the plan 
created a retrospective excuse for their existence, though, he 
added, it probably didn't hurt that while the workers themselves 
would mostly lose their jobs, the executives who made the plan 
43 The Utopia of Rules 
would likely be reloca.ted to a more attractive location. Before 
long, the workers had seized the building, and the perimeter 
was swar ming with riot cops. 
A left critique of bureaucracy, therefore, is sorely lacking. This 
book is not, precis ely, an outline for such a critique. Neither 
is it in. any sense an attempt to develop a general theory of 
bureaucr acy, a history of bureaucracy, or even of the current age 
of total bureaucr acy. It is a collection of essays, each of which 
points at some directions a left-wing critique of bureaucracy 
might take. The first focuses on violence; the second, on tech­
nology; the third, on rationality and value. 
The chapters do not form a single argument. Perhaps they 
could be said to circle around one, but mainly, they are an at­
tempt to begin a conversation-one long overdu e. 
We are all faced with a problem. Bureaucratic practices, hab­
its, and sensibilities engulf us. Our lives have come to be orga­
nized around the filling out of forms.Y et the language we have 
to talk about these things is not just woefully inadequate-it 
might as well have been designed to make the problem worse. 
We need to find a way to talk about what it is we actually 
object to in this process, to speak honestly about the violence 
it entails, but at the same time, to understand what is appealing 
about it, what sustains it, which elements carry within them 
some potential for redemption in a truly free societ y, which 
are best considered the inevitable price to pay for living in any 
complex soci ety, which can and should be entirely eliminated 
entirely. If this book plays even a modest role in sparking such 
a conversati on, it will have made a genuine contribution to 
contemporary political life.

Dead Zones of the 
Ima ginat ion 
An Essay on 
Structu ral Stupid ity 
Let me begin with a story about bureaucra cy. 
In 2006, my mother had a series of strokes. It soon became 
obvious that she would eventually be incapable of living 
at home without assistance. Since her insurance would not 
cover home care, a series of social workers advised us to put 
in for Medicaid. To qualify for Medicaid, however, one's total 
worth can only amount to six thousand dollars, We arranged 
to transf er her savings-this was, I suppose, technica lly a 
scam, though it's a pecu liar sort of scam since the govern­
ment employs thousands of social workers whose main work 
seems to involve telling citizens exactly how to perpetuate 
said scam-but shortly thereafter, she had another, very seri­
ous stroke, and found herself in a nursing home undergoing 
long-term rehabi litation. When she emerged from that, she was 
definitely going to need home care, but there was a problem: 
45 The Utopia of Rules 
her social security check was being deposited directl y, and she 
was barely able to sign her name, so unless I acquired power of 
attorney over her account and was thus able to pay her monthly 
rent bills for her, the money would immediately build up and 
disqualify her, even after I filled out the enormous raft of Med­
icaid documents I needed to file to qualify her for pending 
status. 
I went to her bank, picked up the requisite forms, and 
brought them to the nursing home. The d6cuments needed to 
be notarized. The nurse on the floor informed me there was 
an in-house nota ry, but I needed to make an appointment; she 
picked up the phone and put me through to a disembodied 
voice, who then transferred me to the nota ry. The notary 
proceeded to inform me I first had to get authorization from 
the head of social work, and hung up. So I acquired his name 
and room number and duly took the elevator downstairs and 
appeared at his office-only to discover that the head of social 
work was, in fact, the disembodied voice that had referred me 
to the notary in the first place. The head of social work picked 
up the phone, said, "Marjorie, that was me, you're driving this 
man crazy with this nonsense and you're driving me crazy, too;' 
and, after a small apologetic gesture, proceeded to secure me an 
appointment for early the next week. 
The next week the notary duly appeared, accompanied me 
upstairs, made sure I'd filled out my side of the form (as had 
been repeatedly emphasized to me), and then, in my mother's 
presence, proceeded to fill out her own. I was a little puzzled 
that she didn't ask my mother to sign anything, only me, but I 
figured that she knew what she was doing. The next day I took 
the document to the bank, where the woman at the desk took 
one look, asked why my mother hadn't signed it, and showed it 
to her manager, who told me to take it back and do it right. It 
seemed that the notary indeed had no idea what she was doing. 
So I got new set of forms, duly filled out my side of each, and 
46 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
made a new appointment. On the appointed day the notary 
appeared, and after a few awkward remarks about how difficult 
these banks are (why does each bank insist on having its own, 
completely diff erent power of attorney form?), she took me 
upstairs. I signed, my mother signed-with some difficulty, she 
was finding it hard at this point even to prop herself up-and 
the next day I returned to the bank. Another woman at a dif­
ferent desk examined the forms and asked why I had signed 
the line where it said to write my name and printed my name 
on the line where it said to sign. 
"I did? Well, I just did exactly what the notary told me 
to do." 
"But it clearly says 'signature' here." 
"Oh, yes, it does, doesn't it? I guess she told me wrong. 
Again. Well ... all the inf ormation is still there, isn't it? It's just 
those two bits that are reve rsed. So is that really a problem? The 
situation is kind of pressing, and I'd really rather not have to 
wait to make another appointment." 
"Wel l, normally we don't even accept these forms without 
all the signatories being here in person." 
"My mother had a stroke. She's bedridden. That's why I 
need power of attorney ih the first place." 
She said she'd check with the manager, and after ten min­
utes returned, the manager hanging just within earshot in the 
background, to announce the bank could not accept the forms 
in their present state-and in addition, even if they were filled 
out correct ly, I would still need a letter from my mother's doc­
tor certifying that she was mentally competent to sign such a 
document. 
I pointed out that no one had mentioned any such letter 
previou sly. 
"What?" the manager suddenly interj ected. "Who gave you 
those forms and didn't tell you about the letter?" 
Since the culprit was one of the more sympathetic bank 
47 The Utopia of Rules 
employe es, I dodged the question,4° noting instead that in the 
bankbook it was printed, quite clearly, "in trust for David Grae­
ber." He of course replied that would only matter if she was 
dead. 
As it happened, the whole problem soon became academ ic: 
my mother did indeed die a few weeks later. 
At the time, I found this exp erience extremely disconcert­
ing. Having spent much of my life leading a fairly bohemian 
student existence comp aratively insulated from this sort of 
thing, I found mys elf asking my friends: is this what ordinary 
life, for most people, is really like? Running around feeling like 
an idiot all day? Being somehow put in a position where one 
actually does end up acting like an idiot? Most were inclined to 
suspect that this was indeed what life is mostly like. Obviousl y, 
the notary was unusually incompetent. Still, I had to spend over 
a month not long after dealing with the ramifying consequences 
of the act of whatever anonymous functionary in the New York 
Department of Motor Vehicles had inscribed my given name as 
"Daid;' not to mention the Verizon clerk who spelled my sur­
name "Gruebe r." Bureaucracies public and private appear-for 
whatever historical reasons-to be organized in such a way as 
to guarantee that a significant proportion of actors will not be 
able to perform their tasks as expected. It's in this sense that I've 
said one can fairly say that bureaucracies are utopian forms of 
organization. After all, is this not what we always say of utopians: 
that they have a naive faith in the perf ectibility of human nature 
and refuse to deal with humans as they actually are? Which is, 
are we not also told, what leads them to set impossible standards 
and then blame the individuals for not living up to them?41 But 
in fact all bureaucracies do this, insofar as they set demands they 
insist are reasonable, and then, on discovering that they are not 
reasonable (since a significant number of people will always 
be unable to perform as exp ected) , conclude that the problem 
is not with the demands themselves but with the individual 
48 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
inadequacy of each particular human being who fails to live up 
to them. 
On a purely personal level , probably the most disturbing 
thing was how dealing with these forms somehow rendered me 
stupid, too. How could I not have noticed that I was printing 
my name on the line that said "signature "? It was written right 
there! I like to think that I am not, ordinarily, a particularly 
stupid person. In fact I've made something of a career out con­
vincing others that I'm smart.Y et I was doing obviously foolish 
things ; and not because I wasn't paying attention; in fact, I had 
been investing a great deal of mental and emotion:tl energy 
in the whole affair. The problem, I realized, was not with the 
energy spent, but with the fact that most of this energy was 
being sunk into attempts to try to understand and influence 
whoever, at any moment, seemed to have some kind of bureau­
cratic power over me-when, in fact, all that was required was 
the accurate interpretation of one or two Latin words, and 
correct performance of certain purely mechanical functions. 
Spending so much of my time worrying about how not to 
seem like I was rubbing the notary's face in her incompetence, 
or imagining what might make me seem sympathetic to vari­
ous bank officials, made me less inclined to notice when they 
told me to do something foolish. It was an obviously misp laced 
strate gy, since insofar as anyone had the power to bend the rules 
they were usually not the people I was talking to; moreover, 
if I did encounter someone who did have such power, they 
would invariably inform me directly or indirectly that if I did 
complain in any way, even about a purely structural absurdity , 
the only possible result would be to get some junior function­
ary in trouble. 
As an anthropologist, all this struck me as strangely familiar. 
We anthrop ologists have made something of a specialty out 
of dealing with the ritual surrounding birth, marriage, death, 
and similar rites of passage. We are particul arly concerned with 
49 The Utopia of Rules 
ritual gestures that are socially efficacious: where the mere act 
of saying or doing something makes it socially true. (Think 
of phrases like "I apologize," "I surrender, or "I pronounce 
you man and wife.") Humans being the social creatures that 
they are, birth and death are never mere biological events . It 
normally takes a great deal of work to turn a newborn baby 
into a person ---1iomeone with a name and social relationsh ips 
(mother, father ... ) and a home, towards whom others have 
responsibiliti es, who can someday be expected to have respon­
sibilities to them as well. Usual ly, much of this work 1s done 
through ritual. Such rituals, as anthropologists have noted, can 
vary wildly in form and content: they might involve baptisms, 
confirmations, fumigati ons, first haircuts, isolation, declarati ons, 
the making and waving and burning and burying of ritual para­
phernalia, spells. Death is even more complicated because those 
same social relationships that one has acquired in life have to 
be gradually severed, rearranged. It often takes years , repeated 
burials (even reburials) , burning, bleaching and rearranging of 
bones, feasts, and ceremonies before someone is entirely dead. In 
most existing societies at this point in history, those rituals may 
or may not be carried out, but it is precisely paperwork, rather 
than any other form of ritual, that is socially efficacious in this 
way, that actually eff ects the change. My mother, for example, 
wished to be cremated without ceremony; my main memory 
of the funeral home though was of the plump, good-natured 
clerk who walked me through a fourteen-page document he 
had to file in order to obtain a death certificate, written in 
ballpoint on carbon paper so it came out in triplicate. "How 
many hours a day do you spend filling out forms like that?" 
I asked. He sighed. "It's all I do," holding up a hand bandaged 
from some kind of incipient carpal tunnel syndrome. He had to. 
Without those forms, neither my mother, nor any of the other 
people cremated at his establishment, would be legally-h ence 
socia lly-dead. 
50 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
Why, then, I wondered, are there not vast ethnograp hic 
tomes about American or British rites of passage, with long 
chapters about forms and paperwork? 
There is an obvious answer. Paperwork is boring. One can 
describe the ritual surrounding it. One can observe how people 
talk about or react to it. But when it comes to the paperwork 
itself, there just aren't that many interesting things one can 
say about it. How is the form laid out? What about the color 
scheme? Why did they choose to ask for certain bits of infor­
mation and not others? Why place of birth and not, say, place 
where you went to grade school? What's so important about 
the signature? But even so, even the most imaginative com­
mentator pretty quickly runs out of questions. 
In fact, one could go further. Paperwork is supposed to be 
boring. And it's getting more so all the time. Medieval char­
ters were often quite beautiful, full of calligraphy and heraldic 
embellishment s. Even in the nineteenth century some of this 
remain ed: I have a copy of my grandfather's birth certificate, 
issued in Springfield, Illinois, in 1858, and it's quite colorful, 
with Gothic letters, scrolls and little cherubs (it's also written 
entirely in German) . My father's , in contrast, issued in Law­
rence, Kansas, in 1914, is monochrome and utterly unadorned, 
just lines and box es, though they are filled out in a nice florid 
hand. My own, issued in New York in 1961, lacks even that: it's 
typed and stamped and utte rly without character. But of course 
the computer interf aces used for so many forms nowadays are 
more boring still. It's as if the creators of these documents were 
gradually trying to strip them of anything even slightly pro­
found, or remotely symbolic. 
It's hardly surprising that all this might drive an anthrop olo­
gist to despair. Anthrop ologists are drawn to areas of density. 
The interpretative tools we have at our disposal are best suited 
to wend our way through complex webs of meaning or signifi­
cation-we seek to understand intricate ritual symb olism, social 
51 The Utopia of Rules 
dramas, poetic forms, or kinship networks. What all these have 
in common is that they tend to be both infinitely rich, and, at 
the same time, open-ended. If one sought out to exhaust every 
meaning, motive, or association packed into a single Romanian 
harvest ritual, or Zande witchc raft accusation, or Mexican fam­
ily saga, one could easily spend a lifetime--quite a number of 
lifetimes, in fact, if one were also out to trace the fan of relations 
with other elements in the larger social or symbolic fields such 
work invariably opens up. Paperwork in contrast is designed to 
be maximally simple and self-contained. Even when forms are 
complex, even bafflingly complex, it's by an endless accretion 
of very simple but apparently contradictory elements, like a 
maze composed entirely of the endless juxtaposition of two or 
three very simple geometrical motif s. And like a maze, paper­
work doesn't really open on anything outside itsel f. As a result, 
there just isn't very much to interpret. Clifford Geertz became 
famous for offering a "thick description" of Balinese cockfights 
where he tried to demonstrate that, if one were able to unpack 
everything going on in a given match, one would be able to 
understand everything about Balinese society: they're concep­
tions of the human condition, of societ y, hierarchy, nature, all 
the fundamental passions and dilemmas of human existence. 
This simply would not be possible to do with a mortgage 
applicatio n, no matter how dense the document itself; and even 
if some defiant soul set out to write such an analysis- just to 
prove it could be done--it would be even harder to imagine 
anyone else actually reading it. 
One might object: but haven't great novelists often written 
compelling literature about bureaucracy? Of course they have. 
But they have managed to do this by embracing the very circu­
larity and emptiness-not to mention idiocy-of bureaucracy, 
and producing literary works that partake of something like 
52 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
the same mazelike, senseless form. This is why almost all great 
literature on the sub ject takes the form of horror-comed y. 
Franz Kafka's The Trial is of course the paradigm (as is The 
Castle) , but one can cite any number of others: from Stanislaw 
Lem's Memoirs Found in a Bathtub, which is pretty much straight 
Kafka, to Ismail Kadare's Palace of Dreams and Jose Saramago's 
All the Names, to any number of works that might be said to 
be informed by the bureaucratic spirit, such as much of ltalo 
Calvino or most anything by Borges. Joseph Heller's Catch-22, 
which takes on military bur eaucracies, and Somethin g Happ ened, 
about corporate bureaucrac ies, are considered latter-day master­
works in this genre, as is David Foster Wallace's unfin ished The 
Pale King, an imaginative meditation on the nature of boredom 
set in a Midwestern office of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. 
It's interesting that just about all these works of fiction not only 
emphasize the comic senselessness of bureaucratic life, but mix 
it with at least an undertone of violence. This is more obvious 
in some authors (Kafka and Heller, for example) than others, 
but it almost always seems to be lurking just underneath the 
surface. What's more, contemporary stories that are explicitly 
about violence have a tendency to also become stories about 
bureaucracy, since, after all, most acts of extreme violence either 
take place in bureaucratic environments (armies, prisons ... ) or 
else, they are almost immediately surrounded by bureaucratic 
procedures (crime) . 
Great writers, then, know how to deal with a vacuum. They 
embrace it. They stare into the abyss until the abyss stares back 
into them. Social theory, in contrast, abhors a vacuum-or, this 
is certainly true if its approach to bureaucracy is anything to go 
on. Stupidity and violence are precisely the elements it is least 
inclined to talk about." 
The lack of critical work is especia lly odd because on the 
surf ace, you would think academics are personally positioned 
to speak of the absurdities of bureaucratic life. Of course, this is 
53 The Utopia of Rules 
in part because they are bureaucrats-increasin gly so. "Admin­
istrative responsi bilities;' going to conunittee meetings, filling 
out forms, reading and writing letters of support, placating the 
whims of minor deans-all this takes up an ever-expanding 
portion of the average academic's time. But academics are also 
reluctant bureaucrats , in the sense that even when "admin," as 
it's called, ends up becoming most of what a prof essor actually 
does, it is always treated as something tacked on-not what they 
are really qualified for, certai nly, and not the work that defines 
who they really are.43 They are scholars- people who research, 
analyze, and interpret things-even if incre asingly, they're really· 
scholarly souls trapped in a bureaucrat's bod y. You might think 
that an academic's reaction would be to research, analyze, and 
interpret this very phenomenon: how does it happen that we 
all end up spending more and more of our time on paper work? 
What is the meaning of paperwork anyway? What are the social 
dynamics behind it?Y et for some reason, this never happens.44 
It has been my exp erience that when academics gather 
around the water cooler (or the academic equivalent of a water 
cooler, which is usually a coffee machine) they rarely talk about 
their "real" work but spend almost all their time complaining 
about administrative responsibilit ies. But in those ever- shrinking 
moments where they are allowed to think profound thoughts, 
this seems to be the last thing they'd wish to think about. 
But there i_s something even deeper going on here, I sus­
pect -something that bears on the very nature of what univer­
sities are and why they exist. 
Consider, for exam ple, the extraordinary prominence in U.S. 
social science in the postwar period of two continental theo­
rists: German sociologist Max Weber in the fifties and sixties, 
and French historian and social philosopher Michel Foucault 
ever since. Each attained a kind of intellectual hegemony in 
the United States that they never managed to achieve in their 
own countries. What made them so appealing to American 
54 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
academics? No doubt their popularity had much to do with the 
ease with which each could be adopted as a kind of anti-Marx, 
their theories put forth (usually in crudely simplified form) as 
ways of arguing that power is not simply or primarily a matter 
of the control of production but rather a pervasive, multif aceted, 
and unavoidable feature of any social life. 
But I also think that a large part of the appeal was their 
attitude toward bureaucra cy. Indeed, it sometimes seems that 
these were the only two intelligent human beings in twenti­
eth century history who honestly believed that the power of 
bureaucracy lies in its effectiveness. That is, that bureaucracy 
really works. We ber saw bureaucratic forms of organization as 
the very embodiment of Reason in human affairs, so obvi­
ously superior to any alternative form of organization that they 
threatened to engulf everything, locking humanity in a joyless 
"iron cage," bereft of spirit and charisma. Foucault was more 
subversive, but he was subversive in a way that only endowed 
bureaucratic power with more effectiveness, not less. In his 
work on asylums, clini cs, prisons, and the rest, absolutely every 
aspect of human life-health, sexual ity, work, morality, our very 
conceptions of truth-b ecame nothing in and of themselves, 
but merely products of one or another form of professional or 
administrative discourse. Through concepts like governmental­
ity and biopower, he argued that state bureaucracies end up 
shaping the parameters of human exis tence in ways far more 
intimate than anything We ber would have imagined. For Fou­
cault, all forms of knowledge became forms of power, shaping 
our minds and bodies through largely administrative means. 
It's hard to avoid the suspicion that Weber and Foucault's 
popularity owed much to the fact that the American university 
system during this period had itself increasingly become an 
institution dedicated to producing functionaries for an impe­
rial administrative apparatus, operating on a global scale. In 
the immediate wake ofWorld War II, when the United States 
55 The Utopia of Rules 
was first establishing its global administrative apparatus, all 
this was often fairly explicit. Sociologists like Talcott Parsons 
and Edward Shils45 were deeply embedded in the Cold War 
establishment at Harvard, and the stripped-down version of 
We ber they created was quickly stripped down even further 
and adopted by State Department functionaries and the Wo rld 
Bank as "development theo ry," and actively promoted as an 
alternative to Marxist historical materialism in the battleground 
states of the Global South. At that time, even anthropologists 
like Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Clifford Geertz had 
no compunctions against cooper ating closely with the military­
intelligence apparatus, or even the CIA. 46 All this changed with 
the war in Vietnam. During the course of campus mobilizations 
against the war, this kind of complicity was thrown under a 
spotlight, and Parsons-and with him, Web er-came to be seen 
as the very embodiment of everything radicals sought to reject. 
With Weber dethroned, it was at first unclear who, if anyo ne, 
would replace him. For a while there was a lot of interest in 
German Marxism: Adorno, Ben jamin, Marcuse, Lukacs, Fromm. 
But the focus eventually shifted to France, where the uprising of 
May 1968 had produced an efflorescence of extremely creative 
social theory-in France it was just called " '68 thought"­
that was simultaneously radical in temperament, and hostile to 
almost every traditional manifestation of leftist politics, from 
union organizing to insurrection." Different theorists shifted in 
and out of fashion, but over the course of the eighties, Foucault 
managed to establish himself in a way no one-even, reall y, 
Weber-has before or since. Or, at least, he did so within those 
disciplines that considered themselves in any way oppositional. 
Ultimatel y, it might be better to speak here of the emergence 
of a kind of division of academic labor within the American 
higher education system, with the optimistic side ofW eber 
rein vented (in even more simplified form) for the actual train­
ing of bureaucrats under the name of"r ational choice theo ry," 
56 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
while his pessimistic' side was relegated to the Foucauldians. 
Foucault's ascendancy in turn was precisely within those fields 
of academic endeavor that absorbed former campus radicals, 
or those who identified with them. These disciplines were 
almost completely divorced from any access to political power, 
or increasi ngly, any influence on social movements, as well--"'1 
distance that gave Foucault's emphasis on the "power/knowl­
edge" nexus (the assertion that forms of knowledge are always 
also forms of social power- indeed, the most important forms 
of social power) a particular appeal. 
No doubt any such pocket historical summary can only be 
a bit caricaturish and unfair. Still, I believe there is a profound 
truth here. It is not just that academics are drawn to areas of 
density, where our skills at interpretation are best deployed. We 
also have an increasing tendency to identify what's interesting 
with what's important, and to assume that places of density are 
also places of power. The power of bureaucracy shows just how 
often exactly the opposite is in fact the case. 
But this essay is not just-or not even prim arily--Olb out 
bureaucracy. It is primarily about violence. What I would like 
to argue is that situations created by violence-partic ularly 
structural violence, by which I mean forms of pervasive social 
inequality that are ultimately backed up by the threat of physi­
cal harm-invariably tend to create the kinds of willful blind­
ness we normally associate with bureaucratic procedures. To 
put it crudely: it is not so much that bureaucratic procedures 
are inher ently stupid, or even that they tend to produce behav­
ior that they themselves define as stupid-though they do do 
that- '-but rather, that they are invariably ways of managing 
social situations that are already stupid because they are founded 
on structural violence. This approach, I think, has the potential 
to tell us a great deal about both how bureaucracy has come to 
pervade every aspect of our lives, and why we don't notice it. 
57 The Utopia of Rules 
Now, I admit that this emphasis on violence might seem odd. 
We are not used to thinking of nursing homes or banks or even 
HMOs as violent institutions- except perhaps in the most 
abstract and metaphorical sense. But the violence I'm refer­
ring to here is not abstract. I am not speaking of conceptual 
violence. I am speaking of violence in the literal sense: the kind 
that involve s, say, one person hitting another over the head with 
a wooden stick.All of these are institutions involve djn the allo­
cation of resources within a system of property rights regulated 
and guaranteed by gove rnments in a system that ultimately rests 
on the threat of forc e. "Force" in turn is just a euphemistic way 
to refer to viole nce: that is, the ability to call up people dressed 
in uniforms, willing to threaten to hit others over the head with 
wooden sticks. 
It is curious how rarely citizens in industrial democracies 
actually think about this fact, or how instinctively we try to dis­
count its importa nce. This is what makes it possible, for example, 
for graduate students to be able to spend days in the stacks of 
university libraries poring over Foucault-inspired theoretical 
tracts about the declining importance of coercion as a factor 
in modern life without ever reflecting on that fact that, had 
they insisted on their right to enter the stacks without showing 
a properly stamped and validated ID, armed men would have 
been summoned to physically remove them, using whatever 
force might be required. It's almost as if the more we allow 
aspects of our everyday existence to fall under the purview of 
bureaucratic regulations, the more everyone concerned col­
ludes to downplay the fact (perf ectly obvious to those actually 
running the system) that all of it ultimately depends on the 
threat of physical harm. 
Actual ly, the very use of the term "structural violence" is 
an excellent case in point. When I first began working on this 
essa y, I simply took it for granted that the term referred to 
actual violence that operates in an indir ect form. Imagine, if 
58 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
you will, some warlike tribe (let's call them the Alphas) that 
sweeps out of the desert and seizes a swath of land inhabited 
by peaceful farmers (let's call them the Omegas) . But instead 
· of exacting tribute, they appropriate all the fertile land, and 
arrange for their children to have privileged access to most 
forms of practical education, at the same time initiating a reli­
gious ideology that holds that they are intrinsica lly superior 
beings, finer and more beautiful and more intellig �nt, and that 
the Omegas, now largely reduced to working on their estates, 
have been cursed by the divine powers for some terrible sin, 
and have become stupid, ugly, and base. And perhaps the Ome­
gas internalize their disgrace and come to act as if they believe 
they really are guilty of something. In a sense perhaps they do 
believe it. But on a deeper level it doesn't make a lot of sense 
to ask whether they do or not. The whole arrangement is the 
fruit of violence and can only be maintained by the continual 
threat of viol ence: the fact that the Omegas are quite aware 
that if anyone directly challenged property arrangements, or 
access to education, swords would be drawn and people's heads 
would almost certainly end up being lopped off. In a case like 
this, what we talk about in terms of "belief" are simply the 
psychological techniques people develop to accommodate 
themselves to this reality. We have no idea how they would act, 
or what they would think, if the Alphas' command of the means 
of violence were to somehow disappear. 
This is what I had in mind when I first began using the 
phrase "structural violence"-structures that could only be 
created and maintained by the threat of violence, even if in 
their ordinary, day-to-day workings, no actual physical violence 
need take place. If one reflects on the matter, the same can 
be said of most phenomena that are ordinarily ref erred to as 
"structural violence" in the literature-racism, sexism, class 
privilege-even if their actual mode of operation ·is infinitely 
more complex. 
59 The Utopia of Rules 
Here I was probably inspired most by my readings in feminist 
literature, which often does speak of structural violence in this 
way." It is widely noted, for instance, that rates of sexual assault 
increase dramatically at precisely the moments when women 
begin challenging "gender norms" of work, comportment, or 
dress. It's really quite the same as the conquerors suddenly tak­
ing out their swords again. But for the most part, academics do 
not use the term this way. The current usage really harkens back 
to sixties "Peace Studies," and it is used it to refer to "struc­
tures'' that, it is claime d, have the same effects as violen ce, even 
though they may not involve physical acts of violence at all.49 
The list of structures is pretty much the same list (racism, sex­
ism, poverty, and the rest) , but the implication is there could, for 
example, exist a system of patriarchy that operated in the total 
absence of domestic violence or sexual assault, or a system of 
racism that was in no way backed up by government-enforced 
property rights-d espite the fact that, to my know ledge, no 
example of either has ever been observed. 50 Once again, it's 
puzzling why anyone would make such an argument, unless 
they were for some reason determined to insist that the physi­
cal violence isn't the essence of the thing, that this isn't what 
really needs to be addr essed. To pose the question of violence 
directly would, app arently, mean opening a series of doors 
that most academics seem to feel would really better be left 
shut. 
Most of these doors lead directly to the problem of what we 
call "the state"-and the bureaucratic structures through which 
it actually exercises power. Is the state's claim to a monopoly of 
violence ultimately the problem, or is the state an essential part 
of any possible solution? Is the very practice of laying down 
rules and then threatening physical harm against anyone who 
does not follow them itself objectionable, or is it just that the 
authorities are not deploying such threats in the right way? 
To talk of racism, sexism, and the rest as a bunch of abstract 
60 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
structures floating about is the best way to dodge such ques­
tions entirely. 
In many of the rural communities anthr opologists are most 
familiar with, where modern administrative techniques are 
explicitly seen as alien impositions, things much more resemble 
my example of the Alphas and Omegas. We are usually dealing 
with conquered populations of one sort or another-hence, 
with people who are keenly aware that current arrangements 
are the fruit of violence. As a result, it would never occur to 
anyone to deny that the gov ernment is a fundamentally coer­
cive institution -even if they might also be perfectly willing to 
concede that in certain respects, it could also be a benevolent 
one. In the part of rural Madagascar where I did my fieldwork, 
for example, everyone took it for granted that states operate 
primarily by inspiring fear. It was assumed to be just as true of 
the old Malagasy kingdoms as of the subsequent French colo­
nial regime, or its contemporary Malagasy successor, which was 
seen as basically a slightly retooled version of the same thing. 
On the other hand, the fear it inspired was decidedly sporadic, 
since much of the time, the state, or its representatives, were not 
really around. Gove rnment played almost no role in regulating 
the minutiae of daily life: there were no building codes, no 
open container laws, no mandatory licensing and insurance of 
vehicl es, no rules about who could buy or sell or smoke or build 
or eat or drink what where, where people could play music 
or tend their animals. Or anyway, if there were such laws, no 
one knew what they were because it never occurred to anyone, 
even the police, to enforce them-even in town, and definitely 
not in the surrounding countryside, where such matters were 
entirely regulated by custom, deliberation by communal assem­
blies, or magical taboo. In such contexts, it became all the more 
apparent that the main business of government bureaucracy 
61 The Utopia of Rules 
was the registration of taxable property, and maintaining the 
infrastr ucture that allowed those who collected taxes to show 
up and take their things away. 
This situation actual ly created some interesting dilemmas 
for my own research. I had done a good deal of work in the 
Malagasy national archives before heading out to the coun­
tryside. The nineteenth-ce ntury Merina kingdom had brought 
in foreign missionaries to help them train a civil service, and 
the records were all still there, along with those of the colonial 
regime.As a result, from about 1875 to 1950, I had quite a wealth 
of data for the community I was studying: census data, school 
records, and above all, precise figures about the size of each 
family and its holdings in land and cattle-and in the earlier 
period, slaves. But as soon as I arri ved I discovered this was 
precisely what most people assumed an outsider arri ving from 
the capital would be most likely to ask about, and therefore, 
which they were least inclined to tell them. In fact, people were 
willing to talk about almost anything else. As a result, I had 
almost completely different sorts of data for the two historical 
periods. 
As I got to know people better, I slowly realized that it 
wasn't just that the gov ernment didn't regulate daily life-in 
most important respects, the gov ernment didn't do anything 
at all. State power has a tendency to ebb and flow in Malagasy 
history, and this was a definite ebb. There were gov ernm ent 
offices, of course, and people sat in them typing and register­
ing things, but it was mainly just for show-they were barely 
paid, received no materials (they had to buy their own paper), 
everyone lied on their tax assessments, and no one really paid 
the taxes anyway. Police just patrolled the highway and would 
not go into the coun tryside at all. Yet everyone would talk 
about the gov ernment as if it actually existed, hoping outsid­
ers wouldn't notice, which might possibly lead to someone 
in some office in the capital deciding they might have to do 
62 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
something about the situation. So on one level, bureaucratic 
power had almost no effect on people. On another, it colored 
everything. 
Part of the reason was the initial impact of conquest nearly 
a hundred years before. At the time, most inhabitants of the 
Merina kingdom had been slaveholders, at the heart of a great 
king dom.An important thing to rememb er about slave ry is that 
it is never seen -by anyo ne really-as a moral relationship, but 
one of simple arbitrary power: the master can order the slave to 
do whatever he pleases, and there's really nothing the slave can do 
about it. 51 When the French overthrew the Merina kingdom 
and took over Madagascar in 1895, they simultaneously abol­
ished slave ry and imposed a government that similarly did not 
even pretend to be based on a social contract or the will of the 
gove rned, but was simply based on superior firepower. Unsur­
prisingl y, most Malagasy concluded that they had all been effec­
tively turned into slave s. This had profound relations on how 
people came to deal with one another. Before long, any rela­
tion of command-that is, any ongoing relationship between 
adults where one renders the other a mere extension of his 
or her will-was considered morally objectionable, essentially 
just variations on slavery, or the state. Proper Malagasy people 
didn't act this way. So even though the Malagasy government 
was far away, its shadow was everywhere. In the community I 
studied, such associations were most likely to come to the fore 
when people spoke of the great slave-holding families of the 
nineteenth century, whose children went on to become the 
core of the colonial-era administ ration, largely (it was always 
remarked) by dint of their devotion to education and skill with 
paperwork, and whose descendants still mostly worked in fancy 
offices in the capital, far from the worries and responsibilities of 
rural life. In other contexts, relations of command, particularly 
in bureaucratic contexts, were linguistically coded: they were 
firmly identified with French; Malagasy, in contrast, was seen 
63 The Utopia of Rules 
as the language appropriate to deliberation, explanation, and 
consensus decision-making. Minor functionaries, when they 
wished to impose arbitrary dictates, would almost invariably 
switch to French. 
I have particularly vivid memories of one occasion when 
an affable minor official who had had many conversations with 
me in Malagasy was flustered one day to discover me dropping 
by at exactly the moment everyone had apparently decided to 
go home early to watch a football game. (As I mentioned, they 
weren't really doing anything in these offices anyway.) 
"The office is closed, " he announced, in French, pulling 
himself up into an uncharacteristically formal pose. "If you 
have any business at the office you must return tomorrow at 
eight a.m." 
This puzzled me. He knew English was my native language; 
he knew I spoke fluent Malaga sy; he had no way to know I 
c.ould even understand spoken French. I pretended confusion 
and replied, in Malagasy, "Excuse me? I'm sorry, I don't under­
stand you." 
His response was to pull himself up even taller and just say 
the same thing again, slightly slower and louder. I once again 
feigned incomprehension. "I don't get it," I said, "why are you 
speaking to me in a language I don't even know?" He did it 
agam. 
In fact, he proved utterly incapable of repeating the sentence 
in the vernacular, or, for that matter, of saying anything else at 
all in Malagasy. I suspected this was because if he had switched 
to every day language, he would not feel he could be nearly so 
abrupt. Others later confirmed this was exactly what was hap­
pening: ifhe were speaking Malagasy, he would at the very least 
have had to explain why the office had closed at such an unusual 
time. In literary Malagasy, the French language can actually be 
referred to as ny teny baiko, "the language of command." It was 
characteristic of contexts where explanations, deliberation, and, 
64 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
ultimat ely, consent, were not required, since such contexts were 
shaped by the presumption of unequal access to sheer physical 
force. In this instance, the actual means to deploy such force 
was no longer present. The official could not in fact call the 
police, and nor would he want to-he just wanted me to go 
away, which, after teasing him for a moment with my language 
games, I did. But he couldn't even evoke the kind of attitude 
such power allows one to adopt without calling up the shadow 
of the colonial state. 
In Madagascar, bureaucratic power was somewhat redeemed 
in most people's minds by its connection to education, which 
was held in near-universal esteem. To enter into the world of 
government, bureaus, and gendarme stations was also to enter 
into the world of novels, world history, technology, and poten­
tial travel overseas. It was not therefore irredeemably bad or 
intrinsically absurd. 
But the Malagasy state was also not particula rly violent. 
Comparative analysis suggests there is a direct relation however 
between the level of violence employed in a bureaucratic system, 
and the level of absurdity and ignorance it is seen to produce. 
Keith Breckenridge, for example, has documented at some 
length the regimes of"po wer without knowledge" typical of 
colonial South Africa,52 where coercion and paperwork largely 
substituted for the need for understanding Afri can subjects. 
The actual installation of apartheid that began in the 1950s, for 
example, was heralded by a new pass system that was designed 
to simplify earlier rules that obliged African workers to carry 
extensive documentation oflabor contracts, substituting a single 
identity booklet, marked with their "names, locale, fingerprints, 
tax status, and their officially prescribed 'rights' to live and work 
in the towns and cities," and nothing else. 53 Government fimc­
tionaries appreciated it for streamlining administration, police 
for relieving them of the responsibi lity of having to actually talk 
to African workers. African workers, for their parts, universally 
65 The Utopia of Rules 
referred to the new document as the "dompas," or" stupid pass," 
for precisely that reason. 
Andrew Mathews's brilliant ethnography of the Mexican 
forestry service in Oaxaca likewise demonstrates that it is pre­
cisely the near-total inequality of power between government 
officials and local farmers that allows foresters to remain in a 
kind of ideological bubble, maintaining simple black-and-white 
ideas about forest fires (for instance) that allow them to remain 
pretty much the only people in Oaxaca who don't understand 
what effects their regulations actuall y have. 54 
There are traces of the link between coercion and absurdity 
even in the way we talk about bureaucracy in English: riote for 
example, how most of the colloquial terms that specifically refer 
to bureaucratic foolis hness-SNAFU, Catch- 22, and the like -­
derive from military slang. More genera lly, political scientists 
have long observed a "negative correlation," as David Apter put 
it,55 between coercion and information: that is, while relatively 
democratic regimes tend to be awash in too much information, 
as everyone bombards political authorities with explanations 
and demands, the more authoritarian and repressive a regime, 
the less reason people have to tell it anything-wh ich is why 
such regimes are forc ed to rely so heavily on spies, intelligen ce 
agencies, and secret police. 
Violence's capacity to allow arbitrary decisions, and thus to 
avoid the kind of debate, clarif ication, and renegotiation typical 
of more egalitarian social relations, is obviously what allows 
its victims to see procedures created on the basis of violence 
as stupid or unreasonable. Most of us are capable of getting a 
superficial sense of what others are thinking or feeling just by 
observing their tone of voice, or body language-it's usually 
not hard to get a sense of people's immediate intentions and 
motive s, but going beyond that superficial often takes a great 
66 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
deal of work. Much of the everyday business of social life, in 
fact, consists in trying to decipher others' motives and percep­
tions. Let us call this "interpretive labor." One might say, those 
relying on the fear of force are not obliged to engage in a lot of 
interpr etative labor, and thus, generally speaking, they do not. 
As an anthr opologist, I know I am treading perilous ground 
here. When they do turn their attention to violence, anthro­
pologists tend to emphasize exactly the opposite aspect: the 
ways that acts of violence are meaningf ul and communica­
tive-even the ways that they can resembles poet ry.56 Anyone 
suggesting otherwise is likely to be instantly accused of a kind 
of philistinism: "are you honestly suggesting that violence is not 
symbolically powerful, that bullets and bombs are not meant 
to communicate something?" So for the record: no, I'm not 
suggesting that. But I am suggesting that this might not be the 
most important question. First of all, because it assumes that 
"violence" refers primarily to acts of violence-actual shavings, 
punchings, stabbings, or explosions-rather than to the threat of 
violence, and the kinds of social relations the pervasive threat 
of violence makes possible. 57 Second of all, because this seems 
to be one area where anthropologists, and academics more 
general ly, are partic ularly prone to fall victim to the confusion 
of interpretive depth and social signi ficance. That is, they auto­
matically assume that what is most interesting about violence is 
also what's most imp ortant. 
Let me take these points one at a time. Is it accurate to say 
that acts of violence are, generally speaking, also acts of commu­
nication? It certainly is. But this is true of pretty much any form 
of human action. It strikes me that what is really important 
about violence is that it is perhaps the only form of human 
action that holds out even the possibility of having social effects 
without being communicative. To be more precise: violence may 
well be the only way it is possible for one human being to do 
something which will have relatively pr�dictable effects on the 
67 The Utopia of Rules 
actions of a person about whom they understand nothing. In 
pretty much any other way in which you might try to influence 
another's actions, you must at least have some idea about who 
you think they are, who they think you are, what they might 
want out of the situation, their aversions and proclivit ies, and 
so forth. Hit them over the head hard enough, and all of this 
becomes irrelevant. 
It is true that the effects one can have by disabling or kill­
ing someone are very limited. But they are real enough -an d 
critically, it is possible to know in advance exactly what they 
are going to be. Any alternative form of action cannot, without 
some sort of appeal to shared meanings or understandings, have 
any predictable effects at all. What's more, while attempts to 
influence others by the threat of violence do require some level 
of shared understandings, these can be pretty minimal. Most 
human relations-p articularly ongoing ones, whether between 
longstanding friends or longstanding enemies-are extremely 
complicated, dense with history and meaning. Maintaining 
them requires a constant and often subtle work of imagina­
tion, of endlessly trying to see the world from others' points of 
view. This is what I've already referred to as "interpretive labor." 
Threatening others with physical harm allows the possibility of 
cutting through all this. It makes possible rela tions of a far more 
simple and schematic kind ("cross this line and I will shoot 
you," "one more word out of any of you and you're going to 
jail"). This is of course why violence is so often the pref erred 
weapon of the stupid. One might even call it the trump card 
of the stupid, since (and this is surely one of the tragedies of 
human existence) it is the one form of stupidity to which it is 
most difficult to come up with an intelligent response. 
I do need to intr oduce one crucial qualification here. Every­
thing, here, depends on the balance of forces. If two parties are 
engaged in a relatively equal contest of violenc e-say, generals 
commanding opposing armi es-they have good reason to try 
68 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
to get inside each other's heads. It is only when one side has 
an overwhelming advantage in their capacity to cause physi­
cal harm that they no longer need to do so. But this has very 
profound effects, because it means that the most characteristic 
effect of violence, its ability to obviate the need for "interpre­
tive labor," becomes most salient when. the violence itself is 
least visible-in fact, where acts of spectacular physical violence 
are least likely to occur. These are of course precisely what I 
have just defined as situations of structural violence, systematic 
inequalities ultimately backed up by the threat of force. For 
this reason, situations of structural violence invariably produce 
extreme lopsided structures of imaginative identification. 
These effects are often most visible when the structures of 
inequality take the most deeply internalized forms. Gender is 
again a classic case in point. For example, in American situation 
comedies of the 1950s, there was a constant staple: jokes about 
the impossibility of understanding women. The jokes (told, of 
course, by men) always represented women's logic as fundamen­
tally alien and incomprehensible. "You have to love them," the 
message always seemed to run, "but who can really understand 
how these creatures think?" One never had the impression the 
women in question had any trouble understanding men. The 
reason is obvi ous. Wo men had no choice but to understand 
men. In America, the fifties were the heyday of a certain ideal 
of the one-income patriarchal family, and among the more 
affluent, the ideal was of ten achiev ed.W omen with no access to 
their own income or resources obviously had no choice but to 
spend a great deal of time and energy understanding what their 
menfolk thought was going on. 58 
This kind of rhetoric about the mys teries of womankind 
appears to be a perennial feature of such patriarchal arrange­
ments. It is usually paired with a sense that, though illogical and 
inexplicable, women still have access to mys terious, almost mys­
tical wisdom ("women's intuition") unavailable to men. And of 
69 The Utopia of Rules 
course something like this happens in any relation of extreme 
inequality: peasants, for example, are always represented as 
being both oafishly simple, but someho w, also, mys tically wise. 
Generations of women novelists-Virginia Wo olf comes most 
immediately to mind (To the Lighth ouse)-have documented the 
other side of such arrangements: the constant efforts women 
end up having to expend in managing, maintaining, and adjust­
ing the egos of oblivious and self-important men, involving the 
continual work of imaginative identif ication, or interpretive 
labor. This work carries over on every level . Wo men every­
where are always expected to continually imagine what one 
situation or another would look like from a male point of view. 
Men are almost never expected to do the same for women. So 
deeply internalized is this pattern of behavior that many men 
react to any suggestion that they might do otherwise as if it 
were itself an act of violence. A popular exercise among high 
school creative writing teachers in America, for example, is to 
ask students to imagine they have been transformed, for a day, 
into someone of the opposite sex, and describe what that day 
might be like. The results, apparent ly, are uncannily uniform. 
The girls all write long and detailed essays that clearly show 
they have spent a great deal of time thinking about the subject. 
Usuall y, a good proportion of the boys refuse to write the essay 
entirely. Those who do make it clear they have not the slight­
est conception what being a teenage girl might be like, and 
are outiaged at the suggestion that they should have to think 
about it.59 
Nothing I am saying here is particu larly new to anyone 
familiar with Feminist Standpoint Theory or Critical Race 
Studies. Indeed, I was originally inspired to these broader 
reflections by a passage by bell hooks: 
70 Although there has never been any official body of 
black people in the United States who have gathered Dead Zones of the Imagination 
as anthropologists and/ or ethnographers to study 
whitene ss, black folks have, from slavery on, shared in 
conversations with one another "special" knowledge of 
whiteness gleaned from close scrutiny of white people. 
Deemed special because it is not a way of knowing 
that has been recorded fully in written material, its 
purpose was to help black folks cope and survive in 
a white supremacist society . For years black domestic 
servants, working in white homes, acted as informants 
who brought knowledge back to segregated communi­
ties-details, facts, psychoa nalytic readings of the white 
"Other.''60 
If there is a limitation in the feminist literature, I would 
say, it's that it can be.if anything a tad too gener ous, tending to 
emphasize the insights of the oppressed over the blindness or 
foolishness of their oppressors.61 
Could it be possible to develop a general theory of interpre­
tive labor? We 'd probably have to begin by recognizing that 
there are two critical elements here that, while linked, need to 
be formally distingni shed. The first is the process of imagina­
tive identifi cation as a form of knowledge, the fact that within 
relations of domination, it is generally the subordinates who are 
effectively relegated the work of understanding how the social 
relations in question really work. Anyone who has ever worked 
in a restaurant kitchen, for example, knows that if something · 
goes terribly wrong and an angry boss appears to size things up, 
he is unlikely to carry out a detailed inve stigation, or even to 
pay serious attention to the workers all scrambling to explain 
their version of what happened. He is much more likely to tell 
them all to shut up and arbitrarily imp ose a story that allows 
instant judgment: i.e., "you, Joe, you wouldn't have made a 
mistake like that; you, Mark, you're the new guy, you must have 
screwed up-if you do it again, you're fired." It's those who do 
71 The Utopia of Rules 
not have the power to hire and fire who are left with the work 
of figuring out what actually did go wrong so as to make sure 
it doesn't happen again. The same thing usually happens with 
ongoing relations: everyone knows that servants tend to know 
a great deal about their employers' famil ies, but the opposite 
almost never occurs. 
The second element is the resultant pattern of sympathetic 
identification. Curiously, it was Adam Smith, in his Theory ef 
Moro/ Sentiments, who first observed the phenomenon we now 
refer to as "compassion fatigue." Human beings, he proposed, are 
normally inclined not only to imaginatively identify with their 
fellows, but as a result, to spontaneously feel one another's joys 
and sorrows. The poor, however, are so consistently miserable · 
that otherwise sympathetic observers are simply overwh elmed, 
and are forced, without realizing it, to blot out their existence 
entirely. The result is that while those on the bottom of a social 
ladder spend a great deal of time imagining the perspectives of, 
and genuinely caring about, those on the top, it almost never 
happens the other way around. 
Whether one is dealing with masters and servants, men and 
women, employers and employ ees, rich and poor, structural 
inequalit y-what I've been calling structural violenc e-- invari­
ably creates highly lopsided structures of the imagination. Since 
I think Smith was right to observe that imagination tends to 
bring with it sympathy, the result is that victims of structural 
violence tend to care about its beneficiaries far more than those 
beneficiaries care about them. This might well be, after the 
violence itself, the single most powerful force preserving such 
relations. 
At this point I can return to the question of bureaucracy. 
In contemporary industrialized democracies, the legitimate 
administration of violence is turned over to what is euphemisti­
cally referred to as "criminal law enforcement"-partic ularly, 
72 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
to police officers. I say "euphemistically" because generations 
of police sociologists have pointed out that only a very small 
proportion of what police actually do has anything to do with 
enforc ing criminal law-or with criminal matters of any kind. 
Most of it has to do with regulations, or, to put it slightly more 
technica lly, with the scientific application of physical forc e, or 
the threat of physical force, to aid in the resolution of adminis­
trative problem s. 62 In other words they spend most of their time 
enf orcing all those endless rules and regulations about who can 
buy or smoke or sell or build or eat or drink what where that 
don't exist in places like small-town or rural Madagascar. 
So: Police are bureaucrats with weapons. 
If you think about it, this is a really ingenious trick. Because 
when most of us think about police, we do not think of them 
as enforcing regulations. We think of them as fighting crime, 
and when we think of" crime," the kind of crime we have in 
our minds is violent crime." Even though, in fact, what police 
mostly do is exactly the opposite: they bring the threat of force 
to bear on situations that would otherwise have nothing to 
do with it. I find this all the time in public discussions. When 
trying to come up with a hyp othetical example of a situation 
in which police are likely to be invol ved, people will almost 
invariably think of some act of interpersonal viol ence: a mug­
ging or assault. But even a moment's reflection should make it 
clear that, when most real acts of physical assault do occur, even 
in major cities like Marseille or Montevideo or Minnea po­
lis-domestic violence, gang fights, drunken brawls-the police 
do not get involve d. Police are only likely to be called in if 
someone dies, or is so seriously hurt they end up in the hospital. 
But this is because the moment an ambulance is invo lved, there 
is also paperwork; if someone is treated in the hospital, there 
has to be a cause of injury, the circumstances become relevant, 
police reports have to be filed.And if someone dies there are all 
sorts of forms, up to and including municipal statistics. So the 
only fights which police are sure to get involved in are those 
73 The Utopia of Rules 
that generate some kind of paperwork. The vast majority of 
muggings or burglaries aren't reported either, unless there are 
insurance forms to be filled out, or lost documents that need to 
be replac ed, and which can only be replaced if one files a proper 
police report. So most violent crime does not end up invol ving 
the police. 
On the other hand, try driving down the street of any one 
of those cities in a car without license plates.W e all know what's 
going to happen. Uniformed officers armed with sticks, guns, 
and/ or tasers will appear on the scene almost immediatel y, and 
if you simply refuse to comply with their instructions, violent 
force will, most definit ely, be applied. 
Why are we so confused about what police really do? The 
obvious reason is that in the popular culture of the last fifty 
years or so, police have become almost obsessive objects of 
imaginative identification in popular culture. It has come to the 
point that it's not at all unusual for a citizen in a contemporary 
industrialized democracy to spend several hours a day reading 
books, watching movi es, or viewing TV shows that invite them 
to look at the world from a police point of view, and to vicari­
ously participate in their exploits. And these imaginary police 
do, indeed, spend almost all of their time fighting violent crime, 
or dealing with its consequences. 
If nothing else, all this throws an odd wrinkle into Weber's 
famous worries about the iron cage: the danger that modern 
society will become so well organized by faceless technocrats 
that charismatic heroes, enchantment, and romance will com­
pletel y disa ppear.64 Actu ally, as it turns out, bureaucratic society 
does indeed have a tendency to produce its own, unique forms 
of charismatic hero. These have, since the late nineteenth cen­
tury, arrived in the form of an endless assortment of mythic 
detectives, police officers, and spies-al l, signific antly, figures 
whose job is to operate precisel y where bureaucratic structures 
for ordering information encounter the actual application of 
physical violenc e. Bureaucracy, after all, has been around for 
74 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
thousands of years, and bureaucratic societies, from Sumer 
and Egypt, to Imperial China, have produced great literatu re. 
But modern North Atlantic societies are the very first to 
have created genres of literature where the heroes themselves 
are bureaucrats, or operate entirely within bureaucratic 
envi ronments . 65 
It strikes me that contemplating the role of the police in our 
society actually allows us some interesting insights into social 
theory. Now, I must admit that over the course of this essay I 
have not been especially kind to academics and most of their 
theoretical habits and predilections. I wouldn't be surprised if 
some were inclined to read what I've written as an argument 
that social theory is largely pointless-the self-important fanta­
sies of a cloistered elite who refuse to accept the simple realities 
of power. But this is not what I'm arguing at all. This essay 
is itself an exercise in social theory, and if I didn't think such 
exercises had the potential to throw important light on areas 
that would otherwise remain obscure, I would not have written 
it. The question is what kind, and to what purpose. 
Here a comparison of bureaucratic knowledge and theoreti­
cal knowledge is revealing. Bureaucratic knowledge is all about 
schematization. In practice, bureaucratic procedure invariably 
means ignoring all the subtleties of real social existence and 
reducing everything to preconceived mechanical or statistical 
formulae. Whether it's a matter of forms, rules, statistics, or 
questionnaires, it is always a matter of simplification. Typically, 
it's not very different from the boss who walks into the kitchen 
to make arbitrary snap decisions as to what went wrong: in 
either case it is a matter of applyin g very simple pre-existing 
templates to complex and often ambiguous situations.The result 
often leaves those forced to deal with bureaucratic administra­
tion with the impression that they are dealing with people who 
have for some arbitrary reason decided to put on a set of glasses 
that only allows them to see only 2 percent of what's in front 
of them. But surely, something very similar happens in social 
75 The Utopia of Rules 
theory as well. Anthropologists like to describe what they do 
as "thick description," but in fact an ethnographic description, 
even a very good one, captures at best 2 percent of what's hap­
pening in any particular Nuer feud or Balinese cockfight. A · 
theoretical work that draws on ethnographic descriptions will 
typically focus on only a tiny part of that, plucking perhaps one 
or two strands out of an endlessly complex fabric of human 
circumstance, and using them as the basis on which to make 
generali zations: say, about the dynamics of social conflict, the 
nature of perf ormance, or the principle of hierarchy. 
I am not trying to say there's anything wrong in this kind 
of theoretical reduction. To the contrar y, I am convi nced some 
such process is necessary if one wishes to say something dra­
matically new about the world. 
Consider the role of structural analysis, of the sort that in 
the sixties and seventies was made famous by anthr opologists 
like Claude Levi-Strauss, or classicists like Pan! Vernant. Aca­
demic fashion being what it is, structural analysis is currently 
considered definitively passe, and most anthr opology students 
find Claude Levi-Strauss's entire corpus vaguely ridiculous. 
This strikes me as unfortunate. Certainly insofar as Structural­
ism claimed to be a single, grandiose theory of the nature of 
thought, language, and socie ty, providing the key to unlocking 
all the mysteries of human culture, it was indeed ridiculous and 
has been justifiably abandoned. But structural analysis wasn't a 
theory, it was a technique, and to toss that too out the window, 
as has largely been done, robs us of one our most ingenious 
tools. Because the great merit of structural analysis is that it 
provides a well-nigh foolproof technique for doing what any 
good theory should do: simplifying and schematizing complex 
material in such a way as to be able to say something unex­
pected. This is incidentally how I came up with the point about 
Weber and heroes of bureaucracy a few paragraphs above. It all 
came from an experiment demonstrating structural analysis to 
students at a seminar at Yale. 
76 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
The basic principle of structural analysis, I was explaining, 
is that the terms of a symbolic system do not stand in isola­
tion-they are not to be thought of in terms of what they 
"stand for," but are defined by their relations to each other. One 
has to first define the field, and then look for elements in that 
field that are systematic inve rsions of each other. Take vampire s. 
First you place them: vampires are stock figures in American 
horror movies. American horror movies constitute a kind of 
cosmo logy, a universe unto themselves. Then you ask: what, 
within this cosmos, is the opposite of a vampire? The answer is 
obvious. The opposite of a vampire is a werewolf. On one level 
they are the same: they are both monsters that can bite you and 
by biting you, turn you, too, into one of their own kind. In most 
others ways each is an exact inve rsion of the other. Vampires 
are rich. They are typically aristocrats. We rewolves are always 
poor. Vamp ires are fixed in space: they have castles or crypts 
that they have to retreat to during the dayt ime; werewolves are 
usually homeless derelicts, travelers, or otherwise on the run. 
Vampires control other creatures (bats, wolve s, humans that they 
hyp notize or render thralls .) We rewolves can't control them­
selves.Yet -an d this is really the clincher in this case-each can 
be destroyed only by its own negation: vampires, by a stake, a 
simple sharpened stick that peasants use to construct fences; 
werewolve s, by a silver bullet, something literally made from 
mon ey. 
By observing these axes of inversion, we can get a sense of 
what such symbols are really about: that vamp ires, for instance, 
are not necessarily so much about death, or fear, but about 
power; about the simulta neous feelings of attraction and repul­
sion that relations of domination tend to create. 
Obviously this is an extremely simple example. What I've 
described is just the initial move, there's a whole series of more 
sophisticated ones that normally follow: inve rsions within 
inve rsions, mediating terms, levels of hierarchical encompass­
ment ... There's no need to go into any of that here. My point 
77 The Utopia of Rules 
is just that even by making this initial move, one will almost 
invariably discover something one would not have thought of 
otherwise. It's a way of radically simplifying reality that leads 
to insights one would almost certainly never have achieved 
if one had simply attempted to take on the world in its full 
comp lexity . 
I often used that example when explaining structural analy­
sis to students. Students always liked it. One time, I suggested 
we try collect ively try our hands at another analysis, of a similar 
pop culture figure, and someone suggested James Bond. 
This made sense to me: James Bond is clearly a mythical 
figure of some kind. But who was his mythic opposite? The 
answer soon became obv ious. James Bond was the structural · 
inve rsion of Sherlock Holmes. Both are London-based crime­
fighters, and both permanent adolescents after their own fash­
ion, even mild sociopaths, but otherwise, they are opposites in 
almost every way :

Where Holmes is asexual but fond of cocaine and opium, 
Bond is oversexed, but uninterested in drugs except for liquor. 
Holmes is an amateur. Bond is the quintessential profes­
sional-he seems to have no life outside his work. Yet Hohnes 
is an amateur who is almost preterna turally disciplined and 
competent, far more than the professionals at Scotland Yard, 
while Bond is a professional who is always allowing himself 
to become distracted, blowing his cover, getting captured, or 
disobeying direct orders from his boss.66 
All this, though, really just sets up the key inve rsion, which 
is in terms of what they actually do: Sherlock Holmes seeks 
information about past acts of violence inside his country, while 
James Bond seeks information about future acts of violence 
outside it. 
It was in mapping out the field that I came to realize that 
everything here was organi zed, precis ely, around the relation 
between inf ormation and violenc e-an d that Sherlock Hohnes 
and James Bond are, between them, the quintessential char­
ismatic heroes of bureaucr acy. The classic TV cop, or hero of 
any of the literally hundreds of "maverick-cop-who-breaks­
all-the-rules" movies that Hollyw ood has trundled out since 
the r96os, is clearly a kind of synthesis of these two figures: 
crime-fighters who exist within, but are constantly bursting 
out, of the bureaucratic order, which is nonetheless their entire 
meaning and existence. 67 
One might object that all this is a simplifi cation of a much 
richer, more complex and nuanced, tradition of popular culture. 
Of course it is. That's the whole point. Structural analysis of this 
sort makes a virtue of sim plification. For my own part, I see 
Levi-Strauss as a kind of heroic figure too, a man with the sheer 
intellectual courage to pursue a few simple principles as far as 
they would go, no matter how apparently absurd or just plain 
79 The Utopia of Rules 
wrong the results could sometimes be (the story of Oedipus 
is really about eyes and feet; all social organizations are simply 
systems for the exchange of women)-or, if you prefer, how 
much violence he thus did to reality. Because it's a productive 
violence. And nobody actually gets hurt. 
As long as one remains within the domain of theory, then, 
I would argue that simplifi cation is not necessarily a form of 
stupid ity-it can be a form of intelligence. Even of brillia nce. 
The problems arise at the moment that violence is no longer 
metaphorical. Here let me turn from imaginary cops to real 
ones. Jim Cooper, a former LAPD officer turned sociologist, 68 
has observed that the overwhelming majority of those who 
end up getting beaten or otherwise brutalized by police turn · 
out to be innocent of any crime. "Cops don't beat up burglars," 
he writes. The reason, he explained, is simple: the one thing 
most guaranteed to provoke a violent reaction from police is a 
challenge to their right to, as he puts it, "define the situation." 
That is, to say "no, this isn't a possible crime situation, this is 
a citizen-who-pa ys-your-salary-walki ng-his -dog situatio n, so 
shove off," let alone the invariably disastr ous, "wait, why are 
you handcuffing that guy? He didn't do anything !" It's "talking 
back" above all that inspires beat-downs, and that means chal­
lenging whatever administrative rubric (an orderly or a disor­
derly crowd? A properly or improperly registered vehicle?) has 
been applied by the officer's discretionary judgment. The police 
truncheon is precisely the point where the state's bureaucratic 
imperative for imposing simple administrative schema and its 
monopoly on coercive force ccime together. It only makes 
sense then that bureaucratic violence should consist first and 
foremost of attacks on those who insist on alternative schemas 
or interpretations. At the same time, if one accepts Jean Piaget's 
famous definition of mature intelligence as the ability to 
coordinate between multiple perspect ives (or possible perspec­
tives) one can see, here, precisely how bureaucratic power, at 
80 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
the moment it turns to violence, becomes literally a form of 
infantile stupidity. 
This analysis, too, is no doubt a simplification, but it's a pro­
ductive one. Let me try to demonstrate this by applying some 
of these insights to understanding the type of politics that can 
emerge within a fundamentally bureaucratic society . 
One of the central arguments of this essay so far is that struc­
tural violence creates lopsided structures of the imagination. 
Those on the bottom of the heap have to spend a great deal of 
imaginative energy trying to understand the social dynamics 
that surround them-including having to imagine the perspec­
tives of those on top-while the latter can wander about largely 
oblivious to much of what is going on around them. That is, the 
powerless not only end up doing most of the actual, physical 
labor required to keep society running, they also do most of the 
interpret ive labor as well. 
This much seems to be the case wherever one encounters 
systematic inequ ality. It was just as true in ancient India or 
medieval China as it is anywhere toda y. And it will, presu mably, 
remain true so long as structural inequalities endure. However, 
our own bureaucratic civili zation intr oduces a further ele­
ment. Bureaucracies, I've suggested, are not themselves forms 
of stupidity so much as they are ways of organizing stupid­
ity-of managing relationships that are already characterized 
by extremely unequal structures of imagination, which exist 
because of the existence of structural violence. This is why even 
if a bureaucracy is created for entirely benevole !lt reasons, it will 
still produce absurd ities. And this , in turn, is why I began the 
essay the way I did. I have no reason to believe anyone involve d 
in my mother' s power of attorney drama (even the bank man­
ager) was anything other than well-i ntentioned. Yet an absurd 
and apparently endless run-around nonetheless ensued. 
81 The Utopia of Rules 
Why does this happen? Because even the most benevolent 
bureaucracies are really just taking the highly schematized, 
minimal, blinkered perspec tives typical of the powerful, turn­
ing them into ways of limiting that power or ameliorating its 
most pernicious effects. Surely, bureaucratic interventions along 
these lines have done an enormous amount of good in the 
world. The European social welfare state, with its free education 
a_nd universal health care, can justly be considered ---as Pierre 
Bourdieu once remarked-one of the greatest achievements 
of human civilization. But at the same time, in taking forms of 
willful blindness typical of the powerful and giving them the 
prestige of science-for instance, by adopting a whole series 
of assumptions about the meaning of work, fami ly, neighbor­
hood, knowledge, health, happiness, or success that had almost 
nothing to do with the way poor or working- class people 
actually lived their lives, let alone what they found meaning­
ful in them-it set itself up for a fall. And fall it did. It was 
precisely the uneasiness this blindness created even in the 
minds of its greatest beneficiaries that allowed the Right to 
mobilize popular support for the policies that have gutted and 
devastated even the most successful of these programs since 
the eighti es. 
And how was this uneasiness exp ressed? Largely, by the feel­
ing that bureaucratic authority, by its very nature, repr esented 
a kind of war against the human imagination. This becomes 
particu larly clear if we look at the youth rebellions from China 
to Mexico to New York that culminated in the insurrection of 
May 1968 in Paris .All were rebellions first and foremost against 
bureaucratic authority; all saw bureaucratic authority as funda­
mentally stifling of the human spirit, of creativity, conviviality, 
imagination. The famous slogan "All power to the imagina­
tion," painted on the walls of the Sorbonne, has haunted us ever 
since-endlessly repeated on posters, buttons, flye rs, manif es­
tos, films, and song lyri cs, largely because it seems to embody 
82 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
something fundamental, not just to the spirit of sixties rebellion, 
but to the very essence of what we have come to call "the Left." 
This is important. Actually it could not be more important. 
Because I think what happened in '68 reveals a contradiction 
at the very core of Leftist thought, from its very inception­
• contradiction that only fully revealed itself at precisely the 
high-water mark of its historical success. In the introduction 
to this volume, I suggested that the contemporary Left suffers 
from the lack of a coherent critique of bureaucracy. But if you 
really go back to the beg innings--to the idea that emerged 
around the time of the French Revolution that the political 
spectrum can be divided into a right- and left-w ing in the first 
place-it becomes clear that the Left, in its essence, is a critique 
of bureaucracy, even if it's one that has, again and again, been 
forced to accommodate itself in practice to the very bureau­
cratic structures and mindset it originally arose to oppose. 69 
In this sense, the Left's current inability to formulate a critique 
of bureaucracy that actually speaks to its erstwhile constituents 
is synonymous with the decline of the Left itself. Without such 
a critique, radical thought loses its vital center-it collapses into 
a fragmented scatter of protests and demands. 
It seems that every time the Left decides to take a safe, 
"realistic" course, it just digs itself deeper. To understand how 
this happ ened, let alone what we might be able to do about 
it, I think it will be necessary to reexamine some very basic 
assumptions: first and foremost, about what it means to say one 
is being "real istic" to begin with. 
Be reaiistic: demand the impossible. 
(another '68 slogan) 
So far, I have been discussing how structural violence creates 
lopsided structures of the imagination and how bureaucracy 
83 The Utopia of Rules 
becomes a way of managing such situations-and the forms of 
structural blindness and stupidity they inevitably entail. Even at 
their best, bureaucratic procedures are ways to turn stupid ity, as 
it were, against itself. 
Why do movements challenging such structures so often 
end up creating bureaucracies instead? Norm ally, they do so as a 
kind of compromise. One must be realistic and not demand too 
much. Welf are state reforms seem more realistic than demand­
ing a broad distribution of property; a "transit ional" stage of 
state socialism seems more realistic than jumping inunediately 
to giving power to democra�ically organized workers' councils, 
and so forth. But this raises another questio ;,. When we speak 
of being "realistic," exactly what reality is it we are referring to? · 
Here, I think an anecdote about an activist group I was once 
involved with might prove instructive. 
From early 2000 to late 2002, I was working with the New 
York Direct Action Network-the principal group responsible 
for organizing mass actions as part of the global justice move­
ment in New York City at that time. I call it a "group," but 
technically DAN was not a group at all but a decentralized 
network, operating on principles of direct democracy accord­
ing to an elaborate, but quite effective, form of consensus pro­
cess. It played a central role in ongoing eff orts to create new 
organizational forms. DAN existed in a purely political space. It 
had no concrete resources-not even a significant treasury-to 
administer. 
Then one day someone gave DAN a car. 
The DAN car caused a minor, but ongoing, crisis. We soon 
discovered that legally, it is impossible for a decentralized net­
work to own a car. Cars can be owned by indi viduals, or they 
can be owned by corporations (which are fictive individuals) , 
or by gov ernments. But they cannot be owned by networks. 
Unless we were willing to incorporate ourselves as a non­
profit corporation (which would have required a complete 
84 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
reorganization and an abandonment of most of our egalitarian 
principles) the only expedient was to find a volunteer willing 
to claim to be the legal owner. But then that person was held 
responsible for all outstanding fines and insurance fees, and had 
to provide written permission to allow anyone else to drive 
the car out of state. And, of course, only he could retrieve the 
car if it were impounded. One courageous activist did agree to 
undertake the responsibili ty, but as a result, weekly meetings 
were overwhelmed by reportbacks about his latest legal prob­
lems. Before long the DAN car- had become such an endless 
source of tribulation that we decided to organize a fundraiser, 
throwing a big party where we provided a sledgehammer to 
anyo ne will ing to pay five dollars to take a whack at the thing. 
It struck me there was something profound to this story. 
Why is it that projects like DAN's-pro jects aimed at democ­
ratizing societ y-are so often perceived as idle dreams that 
melt away as soon as they encounter hard material reality? In 
our case, at least, it had nothing to do with inefficiency: police 
chiefS across the country had called us the best organized force 
they'd ever had to deal with. It seems to me that the reality 
eff ect (if one may call it that) comes rather from the fact that 
radical projects tend to founder-or at least become endlessly 
difficult-the moment they enter into the world oflarge, heavy 
objects: buildings, cars, tractors, boats, industrial machinery.This 
in turn is not because these objects are somehow intrinsically 
difficult to administer democraticall y- history is·fu ll of com­
munities that success fully engage in the democratic adminis­
tration of common resources -it's because, like the DAN car, 
they are surrounded by endless government regulation, and are 
effectively impossible to hide from the government's armed 
representatives. In America, I have seen endless examples of this 
dilemma. A squat is legalized after a long struggle; sudden ly, 
building insp ectors arrive to announce it will take ten thousand 
dollars' worth of repairs to bring it up to code. Organizers are 
85 The Utopia of Rules 
therefore forced to spend the next several years organizing bake 
sales and soliciting contributions. This means setting up bank 
accounts, which means, in turn, adhering to legal regulations 
that specify how any group receiving funds, or dealing with 
the government, must be organized (again, not as an egalitarian 
collectiv e). All these regulations are enf orced by violence.T rue, 
in ordinary life, police rarely come in swinging billy clubs to 
enforce building code regulati ons, but, as an.archists often are 
often uniquely .positioned to find out, if one simply pretends 
the state and its regulations don't exist, this will, eventu ally, hap­
pen. The rarity with which the nightsticks actually appear just 
helps to make the violence harder to see. This in turn makes 
the eff ects of all these regulations-regulations that almost · 
always assume that normal relations between individuals are 
mediated by the market, and that normal groups are organized 
internally by relations of hierarchy and command-seem to 
emanate not from the government's monopoly of the use of 
force, but from the largeness, solidity, and heaviness of the 
objects themselves. 
When one is asked to be "realist ic;' then, the reality one is 
normally being asked to recognize is not one of natural, mate­
rial facts, nor some supposed ugly truth about human nature. 
Being "realistic " usually means taking seriously the effects of 
the systematic threat of violence. This possibility even threads 
our langu age.Wh y, for example, is a building referred to as "real 
proper ty," or "real estate"? The "real" in this usage is not derived 
from Latin res, or "thi ng": it's from the Spanish real, meaning, 
"royal," "belonging to the king." All land within a sovereign 
territory ultimately belongs to the sovereign- legally this is still 
the case. This is why the state has the right to impose its regula­
tions. But sovereignty ultimately comes down to a monopoly 
on what is euphemistica lly referred to as "force"-that is, vio­
lence. Just as the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben argued 
that from the perspec tive of sovereign power, something is alive 
86 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
because you can kill it, so property is "real" because the state can 
seize or destroy it. 
In the same way, when one takes a "realist" position in Inter­
national Relations, one assumes that states will use whatever 
capacities they have at their disposal, including force of arms, to 
pursue their national inter ests.W hat" reality" is one recognizing? 
Certainly not material reality. The idea that nations are human­
like entities with purposes and interests is purely metaphysical. 
The King of France had purposes and interests. "Franc e" does 
not. What makes it seem "realisti c" to suggest it does is simply 
that those in control of nation-states have the power to raise 
armies, launch invasi ons, and bomb cities, and can otherwise 
threaten the use of organized violence in the name of what 
they describe as their "national interests"-and that it would 
be foolish to ignore that possibil ity. National interests are real 
because they can kill you. 
The critical term here is "force," as in "the state's monopoly 
on the use of coercive force." Whenever we hear this word 
invoked, we find ourselves in the presence of a political ontol­
ogy in which the power to destr oy, to cause others pain or to 
threaten to break, damage, or mangle others' bodies (or just 
lock them in a tiny room for the rest of their lives) is treated as 
the social equivalent of the very energy that drives the cosmos. 
Contemplate, if you will, the metaphors and displacements that 
make it possible to construct the following two sentences: 
Scientists investigate the nature of physical laws so as to 
understand the forces that govern the unive rse. 
Police are experts in the scientific application of physical force 
in order to enforce the laws that govern societ y. 
This is to my mind the essence of right-wing thought: a 
political ontology that through such subtle means allows 
87 The Utopia of Rules 
violence to define the very parameters of social existence and 
common sense. 70 
This is why I say that the Left has always been, in its essen­
tial inspiration, antibure aucratic. Because it has always been 
founded on a differ ent set of assumptions about what is ulti­
mately real-that is, about the very grounds of political being. 
Obviously Leftists don't deny the reality of violence. Many 
Leftist theorists think �bout it quite a lot. But they don't tend 
to give it the same foundational status. Instead, I would argue 
that Leftist thought is founded on what I will call a "political 
ontology of the imagination" (though it could also, perhaps just 
as well, have been called an ontology of creativity or making or 
inventio n.) Nowadays, most of us tend to identify this tendency 
with the legacy of Marx, with his emphasis on social revolution 
and forces of material production. Marx was ultimately only 
a man of his time, and his terms emerged from much wider 
arguments about value, labor, and creativity current in radical 
circles of his day, whether in the work ers' movement, or for 
that matter in various strains of Romanticism and bohemian 
life emerging around him in Paris and London at the time. 
Marx himself, for all his contempt for the utopian Socialists of 
his day, never ceased to insist that what makes human beings 
different from animals is that archite cts, unlike bees, first raise 
their structures in the imagination. It was the unique property 
of humans, for Marx, that . they first envision things, and only 
then bring them into being. It was this process he ref erred to as 
''production.'' 
Around the same time, utopian Socialists like St. Simon were 
arguing that artists needed to become the avant-garde or "van­
guard," as he put it, of a new social order, providing the grand 
visions that industry now had the power to bring into being. 
What at the time might have seemed the fantasy of an eccentric 
pamphleteer soon became the charter for a sporadic, uncertain, 
but apparently permanent alliance that endures to this day. If 
88 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
artistic avant-gardes and social revolutionaries have felt a pecu­
liar affinity for one another ever since, borrowing each other's 
languages and ideas, it appears to have been insofar as both have 
remained conunitted to the idea that the ultimate, hidden truth 
of the world is that it is something that we make, and could 
just as easily make diff erently. In this sense, a phrase like "all 
power to the imagination" expresses the very quintes sence of 
the Left. 
From a left perspect ive, then, the hidden reality of human 
life is the fact that the world doesn't just happ en. It isn't a 
natural fact, even though we tend to treat it as if it is-it exists 
because we all collecti vely produce it. We imagine things we'd 
like and then we bring them into being. But the moment you 
think about it in these terms, it's obvious that something has 
gone terribly wrong. Since who, if they could simply imagine 
any world that they liked and then bring it into being, would 
create a world like this one?71 Perhaps the leftist sensibility was 
expre ssed in its purest form in the words of Marxist philosopher 
John Hollo way, who once wanted to title a book, "Stop Making 
Capital ism.'"' Capitalism, he noted, is not something imposed 
on us by some outside force. It only exists because every day 
we wake up and continue to produce it. If we woke up one 
morning and all collec tively decided to produce something else, 
then we wouldn't have capitalism anymore. This is the ultimate 
revolutionary question: what are the conditions that would have 
to exist to enable us to do this-to just wake up· and imagine 
and produce something else? 
To this emphasis on forces of creativity and production, the 
Right tends to reply that revolu tionaries systematically neglect 
the social and historical importance of the "means of destruc­
tion ": states, armies, executioners, barbarian invasions, criminals, 
unruly mobs, and so on. Pretending such things are not there, or 
can simply be wished away, they argue, has the result of ensur­
ing that left-wing regimes will in fact create far more death and 
89 The Utopia of Rules 
destruction than those that have the wisdom to take a more 
"realistic " appro ach. 
Obvious ly, this is something of a simplif ication, and one 
could make endless qualifi cations. The bourgeoisie of Marx's 
time, for instance, had an extremely productivist philosoph y­
one reason Marx could see it as a revo lutionary force. Elements 
of the Right dabbled with the artistic ideal, and twentieth­
century Marxist regimes often embr aced essentially right-wing 
theories of power and paid little more than lip service to the 
determinant nature of production. On the other hand, in their 
obsession with jailing poets and playwrights whose work they 
considered threatening, they evinced a profound ·faith in the 
power of art and creativity to change the world- those running 
capitalist regimes rarely bothered, convinced that if they kept 
a firm hand on the means of productions (and, of course, the 
army and police), the rest would take care of itself. 
One of the reasons it is difficult to see all this is because the 
word "imaginat ion" can mean so many diff erent things. In most 
modern definitions imagination is counterposed to reality; 
"imaginary" things are first and foremost things that aren't really 
there. This cari cause a great deal of confusion when we speak 
of imagination in the abstract, because it makes it seem like 
imagination has much more do with Spenser's Faerie Queene 
than with a group of waitr esses trying to figure out how to 
placate the couple at Table 7 before the boss shows up. 
Still, this way of thinking about imagination is relatively new, 
and continues to coexist with much older ones. In the common · 
Ancient and Medieval conception, for example, what we now 
call "the imagin ation" was not seen as opposed to reality per 
se, but as a kind of middle ground,-a zone of passage connect­
ing material reality and the rational soul. This was especially 
90 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
true for those who saw Reason as essentia lly an aspect of God, 
who felt that thought therefore partook in a divinity which in 
no way partook of-indeed, was absolutely alien to-material 
reality. (This became the dominant position in the Christian 
Middle Ages.) How, then, was it possible for the rational mind 
to receive sense impressions from nature? 
The solution was to propose an intermediary substan ce, 
made out of the same material as the stars, the "pneuma;' a 
. kind of circulatory system through which perceptions pf the 
material world could pass, becoming emotionally charged in 
the process and mixing with all sorts of phantasms, before the 
rational mind could grasp their signi ficance. Intentions and 
desires moved in the opposite direction, circulating through 
the imagination before they could be realized in the world. It's 
only after Descartes, really, that the word "imaginary" came to 
mean, specifica lly, anything that is not real: imaginary creatures, 
imaginary places (Narnia, planets in faraway galaxie s, the King­
dom of Prester John) , imaginary friends. By this definition, a 
"political ontology of the imagination" could only be a contra­
diction in terms. The imagination cannot be the basis of reality. 
It is by definition that which we can think, but which has no 
reality. 
I'll refer to this latter as "the trans cendent notion of the 
imagina tion" since it seems to take as its model novels or other 
works of fiction that create imaginary worlds that presumably 
remain the same no matter how many times one reads them. 
Imaginary creatures-elves or unicorns or TV cops-are not 
affected by the real world. They cannot be, since they don't exist. 
In contrast, the kind of imagination I have been developing 
in this essay is much closer to the old, immanent, conception. 
Criticall y, it is in no sense static and free-floating, but entirely 
caught up in projects of action that aim to have real effects on 
the material world, and as such, always changing and adapting. 
This is equally true whether one is crafting a knife or a piece 
91 The Utopia of Rules 
of jewelry, or trying to make sure .one doesn't hurt a friend' s 
feelings. 
It was precisely in the mid- to late-eighteenth cent ury, which 
saw the origins of industrial capita lism, modern bureaucratic 
society , and the political division between right and left, where 
the new trans cendent concept of imagination really came to 
promine nce. For Romantics, in particular, the ImaginatiOn 
came to take the place once held by the soul-rather than 
mediating between the rational soul and the material world, it 
was the soul, and the soul was that which was beyorid any mere 
rationality. It's easy to see how the advent of an impersonal, 
bureaucratic order of offices, factories, and rational· administra­
tion would also give rise to this sort of idea. But insofar as· 
the imagination became a residu al cate gory , everything that the 
new order was not, it also was not purely transcendent; in fact, 
it necessarily became a kind of crazy hodgepodge of what I've 
been calling transcendent and immanent principles. On the one 
hand, the imagination .was seen as the source of art, and all 
creativity. On the other, it was the basis of human symp athy, and 
hence morality.73 
Two hundred and fifty years later, we might do well to begin 
to sort these matters out. 
Because honest ly, there's a lot at stake here. To get a sense 
of just how much, let's return for a moment to that '68 slo­
gan: "All power to the imagination." Which imagination are 
we referring to? If one takes this to refer to the transcendent 
imagination-to an attempt to impose some sort of prefab 
utopian vision-the effects can be disastro us. Historically; it has 
often meant creating some vast bureaucratic machine designed 
to impose such utopian visions by violence. Worl d-class atroci­
ties are likely to result. On the other hand, in a revolutionary 
situation, one might by the same token argue that not giving 
full power to the other, immanent, sort of imagination-the 
practical common sense imagination of ordinary cooks, nurses, 
92 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
mechanics and gardeners-is likely to end up having exactly 
the same effects. 
This confusion, this jumbling of diff erent conceptions of 
imagina tion, runs throughout the history ofleftist thought. 
One can already see the tension in Marx. There is a strange 
paradox in his approach to revo lution.As I've noted, Marx insists 
that 'what makes us human is that rather than relying on uncon­
scious instinct like spiders and bees, we first raise structures in 
our imagination, and then try to bring those visions into being. 
When a spider weaves her web, she operates on instinct. The 
architect first draws up a plan, and only then starts building 
the foundations of his edific e. This is true, Marx insists, in all 
forms of material production, whether we are building bridges 
or making boots. Yet when Marx speaks of social creativity, his 
key example-the only kind of social creativity he ever talks 
about actu ally-is always revolution, and when he does that, he 
suddenly changes gears complet ely. In fact he reverses himself. 
The revolutionary should never proceed like the archite ct; he 
should never begin by drawing up a plan for an ideal society , 
then think about how to bring it into being. That would be 
utopianism. And for utopianism, Marx had nothing but with­
ering contempt. Instead, revolution is the actual immanent 
practice of the proletariat, which will ultimately bear fruit in 
ways that we cannot possibly imagine from our current van­
tage point. 
Why the discrepancy? The most generous explanatio n, I 
would sugg est, is that Marx did understand, at least on some 
intuitive level, that the imagination worked differently in the 
domain of material production than it did in social relat ions; 
but also, that he lacked an adequate theory as to why. Perhaps, 
writing in the mid-nineteenth centur y, long before the rise of 
feminism, he simply lacked the intellectual tools.'4 Given the 
considerations already outlined in this essay, I think we can 
confirm that this is indeed the case. To put it in Marx's own 
93 The Utopia of Rules 
terms: in both domains one can speak of alienation. But in each, 
alienation works in profoundly different ways. 
To recall the argument so far: structural inequalities always 
create what I've called "lopsided structures of imagination," that 
is, divisions between one class of people who end up doing 
most of the imaginative labor, and others who do not. However, 
the sphere of factory production that Marx concerned himself 
with is rather unusual in this resp ect. It is one of the few con­
texts where it is the dominant class who end up doing more 
imaginative labor, not less. 
Creativity and desir e-- what we often reduce, in political 
economy terins,. to "production" and "consumption"-are 
essentially vehicles of the imaginat ion. Structures of inequal- · 
ity and domination -------cStructural violence, if you will-tend to 
skew the imagination. Structural violence might create situa­
tions where laborers are relegated to mind-numbing, boring, 
mechanical jobs, and only a small elite is allowed to indulge 
in imaginative labor, leading to the feeling, on the part of the 
workers, that they are alienated from their own labor, that their 
very deeds belong to someone else. It might also create social 
situations where kings, politicians, celebrities, or CEOs prance 
about oblivious to almost everything around them while their 
wive s, servants, staff, and handlers spend all their time engaged 
in the imaginative work; of maintaining them in their fantasies. 
Most situations of inequality I suspect combine elements of 
both. 
The subj ective experience of living inside such lopsided 
s(ructures of imagination-the warping and shattering of 
imagination that results-is what we are referring to when we 
talk about "alienation." 
The tradition of Political Eco nomy, within which Marx was 
writing, tends to see work in modern societies as divided between 
two spheres: wage labor, for which the paradigm is always fac­
tories, and domestic labor-housework, childcar e-- relegated 
94 Dead Zones of the Imagina tion 
mainly to women. The first is seen primarily as a matter of cre­
ating and maintaining physical objects. The second is probably 
best seen as a matter of creating and maintaining people and 
social relations. The distinction is obviously a bit of a caricature: 
there has never been a society, not even Engels's Manchester 
or Victor Hngo's Paris, where most men were factory workers 
and most women worked exclusively as housewives. Still, this 
frames how we think about such issues tod ay. It also points 
to the root of Marx's problem. In the sphere of industry , it is 
generally those on top that relegate to themselves the more 
imaginative tasks (i.e., they design the products and organize 
producti on), whereas when inequalities emerge in the sphere 
of social production, it is those on the bottom who end up 
expected to do the major imaginative work-notably, the bulk 
of what I've called the "labor of interpretation" that keeps life 
running. 75 
So far I have proposed that bureaucratic procedures, which have 
an uncanny ability to make even the smartest people act like 
idiots, are not so much forms of stupidity in themselves, as they 
are ways of managing situations already stupid because of the 
effects of structural violence. As a result, such procedures come 
to partake of the very blindness and foolishness they seek to 
manage. At their best, they become ways of turning stupidity 
against itself, much in the same way that revolutionary violence 
could be said to be. But stupidity in the name of fairness and 
decency is still stupidity, and violence in the name of human 
liberation is still violence. It's no coincidence the two so often 
seem to arrive together. 
For much of the last century, the great revolutionary ques­
tion has thus been: how does one affect fundamental change in 
society without setting in train a process that will end with the 
95 The Utopia of Rules 
creation of some new, violent bureaucracy? Is utopianism the 
problem-the very idea of imagining a better world and then 
trying to bring it into being? Or is it something in the very 
nature of social theory? Should we thus abandon social theory? 
Or is the notion of revolution itself fundamentally flawed? 
Since the sixties, one common solution has been to start 
by lowering one's sights. In the years leading up to May '68, 
the Situationists famously argued that it was possible to do this 
through creative acts of subversion that undermined the logic 
of what they called "the Spectacle;' which rendered us passive 
consumers. Through these acts, we could, at least momentaril y, 
recapture our imaginative powers. At the same time, they also 
felt that all such acts were small-scale dress rehearsals for the' 
great insurrectionary moment to which they would necessarily 
lead-"the" revolution, properly speaking. This is what's largely 
gone toda y. If the events of May '68 showed anyth ing, it was that 
if one does not aim to seize state power, there can be no funda­
mental, onetime break. As a result, among most contemporary 
revo lutionaries, that millenarian element has almost completely 
fallen away. No one thinks the skies are about to open any time 
soon. There is a consolation, though: that as a result, insof ar as 
one actually can come to exp eriencing genuine revolutionary 
freedom, one can begin to experience it immediatel y. Consider 
the following statement from the Crimethinc collective, prob­
ably the most inspiring young anarchist propagandists operating 
in the Situationist tradition today: 
96 We must make our freedom by cutting holes in the 
fabric of this reality, by forging new real ities which will, 
in turn, fashion us. Putting yourself in new situations 
constantly is the only way to ensure that you make 
your decisions unencumbered by the inertia of habit, 
custom, law, or prejudic e--a nd it is up to you to create 
these situations Dead Zones of the Imagination 
Freedom only exists in the moment of revolu­
tion. And those moments are not as rare as you think. 
Change, revolutionary change, is going on constantly 
and everywhe re--and everyone plays a part in it, con­
sciously or not. 
What is this but an elegant statement of the logic of direct 
action: the defiant insistence on acting as if one is already free?7 6 
The obvious question is how this approach can contribute to an 
overall strategy-one that should lead, perhaps not to a single 
moment of revolutionary redemption, but to a cumulative 
movement towards a world without states and capitalism. On 
this point, no one is completely sure. Most assume the process 
could only be one of endless impro visation. Insurrectionary 
moments there will surely be. Likely as not, quite a few of them. 
But they will most likely be one element in a far more complex 
and mult ifaceted revolutionary process whose outlines could 
hardly, at this point, be fully anticip ated. 
In retr ospect, what seems strikingly naive is the old assump­
tion that a single uprising or succes sful civil war could, as it 
were, neutralize the entire apparatus of structural violence, at 
least within a particular national territor y-that within that 
territory , right-wing realities could be simply swept away, to 
leave the field open for an untrammeled outpouring of revolu_: 
tionary crea tivity. But the truly puzzling thing is that, at certain 
moments of human histo ry, that appeared to be. exactly what 
was happening. It seems to me that if we are to have any chance 
of grasping the new, emerging conception of revo lution, we 
need to begin by thinking again about the quality of these 
insurrectionary moments. 
One of the most remarkable things about such insurrection­
ary uphea vals is how they can seem to burst out of nowhere- ­
and then, often, dissolve away just as quic kly. How is it that the 
same "public" tliat two months before say, the Paris Commune, 
97 The Utopia of Rules 
or the Spanish Civil War, had voted in a fairly moderate social 
democratic regime will suddenly find itself willing to risk 
their lives for the same ultra-radicals who received a fraction 
of the actual vote? Or, to return to May '68, how is it that the 
same public that seemed to support or at least feel strongly 
sympathetic toward the student/worker uprising could almost 
immediately afterwards return to the polls and elect a right­
wing government? The most common historical explana­
tions-that the revolutionaries didn't really represent the public 
or its interests, but that elements of the public perhaps became 
caught up in some sort of irrational effervescenc e--s eem obvi­
ously inadequate. First of all, they assume that "the public" is 
an entity with opinions, interests, and allegiances that can be· 
treated as relatively consistent over time. In fact what we call 
"the public " is created, produced through specific institutions 
that allow specific forms of action-taking ' polls, watchi .ng 
television, voting, signing petitions or writing letters to elected 
officials or attending public hearings-and not others. These 
frames of action imply certain ways of talking, thinking, argu­
ing, deliberating. The same "public" that may widely indulge in 
the use of recreational chemicals may also consisten rly vote to 
make such indulgences illegal; the same collection of citizens is 
likely to come to completely different decisions on questions 
affecting their communities if organ ized into a parliamentary 
system, a system of computerized plebiscites, or a nested series 
of public assemblie s. In fact the entire anarchist proj ect of 
reinventing direct democracy is premised on assuming this is 
the case. 
To illustrate what I mean, consider that in English-speaking 
nations, the same collection of people referred to in one context 
as "the publi c" can in another be referred to as "the workf orce." 
They become a "workf orce;' of course, when they are engaged 
in diff erent sorts of activity. The "public" does not work-a 
sentence like "most of the American public works in the service 
98 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
industry" would never appear in a magazine or paper, and if a · 
journalist were to attempt to write such a sentence, her editor 
would certainly change it to something else. It is especially odd 
since the public does apparently have to go to work: this is why, 
as leftist critics often complain, the media will always talk about 
how, say, a transport strike is likely to inconvenience the public, 
in their capacity of commuters, but it will never occur to them 
that those striking are themselves part of the public-or that if 
they succeed in raising wage levels, this will be a public benefit. 
And certainly the "public" does not go out into the streets. Its 
role is as audience to public spectacles, and consumers of public 
servi ces·. When buying or using goods and servi ces privately 
supplied, the same collection of individuals become something 
else ("consumers") ,just as in other contexts of action they are 
relabeled a "nation,"" electorate ," or "population." 
All these entities are the product of bureaucracies and insti­
tutional practices that, in tum, define certain horizons of possi­
bility . Hence when voting in parliamentary elections one might 
feel obliged to make a "realistic" choice; in an insurrectionary 
situation, on the other hand, suddenly anything seems possible. 
What "the publi c," "the workforce," "the electorate," "con­
sumers," and "the population" all have in common is that they 
are brought into being by institutionalized frames of action that 
are inherently bureaucratic, and therefore, profoundly alienat-· 
ing. Voting booths, television screens, office cubicles, hospitals, 
the ritual that surrounds them-one might say these are the 
very machinery of alienation. They are the instruments through 
which the human imagination is smashed and shattered. Insur­
rectionary moments are moments when this bureaucratic appa­
ratus is neutralized. Doing so always seems to have the effect 
of throwing hor izons of possibility wide open, which is only 
to be expected if one of the main things that that apparatus 
normally does is to enforce extremely limited horizons. (This is 
probably why, as Rebecca Solnit has so beautifully observed,77 
99 The Utopia of Rules 
people often experience something very similar during 
natural disasters.) All of this woul? explain why revo lution­
ary moments always seem to be followed by an outpouring 
of social, artistic, and intellectual creativity. Normally unequal 
structures of imaginative identification are disrupted; every one 
is exp erimenting with trying to see the world from unfami liar 
points of view; everyone feels not only the right, but usually the 
immediate practical need to re-create and reimagine everything 
around them. 
The question, of course, is how to ensure that those who go 
through this exp erience are not immediately reorganized under. 
some new rubric-the people, the proletariat, the multitude, 
the nation, the ummah, whatever it may be--that then gives 
way to the construction of a new set of rules, regulati ons, and 
bureaucratic institutions around it, which will inevitably come 
to be enforced by new categories of police. I actua lly think 
that here, some progress has been mad e.A lot of the credit goes 
to feminism. Since at least the seventies, there has been a self­
conscious effort among those seeking radical change to shift the 
emphasis away from millenarian dreams and onto much more 
immediate questions about how those "holes cut in the fabric 
of reality" might actually be organized in a non-bureaucratic 
fashion, so that at least some of that imaginative power can 
be sustained over the long term. This was already true of the 
great Festivals of Resistance organized around trade summits 
by the Globa! Justice movement from !998 to 2003, where the 
intricate details of the process of democratic planning for the 
actions was, if anything, more important than the actions them­
selves, but it became even more true in 2on with the camps 
of the Arab Spring, the great assemblies of Greece and Spain, 
and finally, the Occupy movement in the United States. These 
were simultaneously direct actions, practical demonstrations of 
how real democracy could be thrown in the face of power, 
and experiments in what a genuinely non-bureaucrati zed 
100 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
social order, based on the power of practical imagination, might 
look like. 
Such is the lesson, I think, for politics. If one resists the reality 
effect created by pervasive structural violence-the way that 
bureaucratic regulations seem to disappear into the very mass 
and solidity of the large heavy objects around us, the buildings, 
vehi cles,.large concrete structures, making a world regulated by 
such principles seem natural and inevitable, and anything else a 
dreamy fantasy-it is possible to give power to the imagination. 
But it also requires an enormous amount of work. 
Power makes you lazy. Insof ar as our earlier theoretical dis­
cussion of structural violence revealed anything, it was this: that 
while those in situations of power and privilege often feel it 
as a terrible burden of responsi bility, in most ways, most of the 
time, power is all about what you don't have to worry about, 
don't have to know about, and don't have to do. Bureaucracies 
can democratize this sort of power, at least to an extent, but 
they can't get rid of it. It becomes forms of institutionalized 
laziness. Revolutionary change may involve the exhilaration 
of throwing off imaginative shackles, of suddenly realizing that 
impossible things are not impossible at all, but it also means 
most people will have to get over some of this deeply habitu­
ated laziness and start engaging in interpretive (imaginative) 
labor for a very long time to make those realities stick. 
I have spent much of the last two decades thinking about 
how social theory might contribute to this process. As I've 
emphasized, social theory itself could be seen as kind of radical 
simplification, a form of calculated ignorance, a way of putting 
on a set of blinkers designed to reveal patterns one could never 
otherwise be able to see. 
What I've been trying to do, then, is to put on one set of 
blinkers that allows us to see another. That's why I began the 
101 The Utopia of Rules 
essay as I did, with the paperwork surrounding my mother's ill­
ness and death. I wanted to bring social theory to bear on those 
places that seem most hostile to it. There are dead zones that 
riddle our lives, areas so devoid of any possibility of interpretive 
depth that they repel every attempt to give them value or mean­
ing. These are spaces, as I discovered, where interpretive labor 
no longer works. It's hardly surprising that we don't like to talk 
about them. They repel the imagination. But I also believe we 
have a responsibility to confront them, because if we don't, we 
risk becoming complicit in the very violence that creates them. 
Let me explain what I mean by this. The tendency in exist­
ing social theory is to romanticize violence: to treat violent acts 
above all as ways to send dramatic messages, to play with sym-. 
bols of absolute power, purification, and terror. Now, I'm not 
saying this is exactly untrue. Most acts of violence are also, in 
this sort of very literal sense, acts of terrorism. But I would also 
insist that focusing on these most dramatic aspects of violence 
makes it easy to ignore the fact that one of the salient features 
of violence, and of situations it creates, is that it is very boring. 
In American prisons, which are extraordinary violent places, 
the most vicious form of punishment is simply to lock a person 
in an empty room for years with absolutely nothing to do. This 
emptying of any possibility of communication or meaning is 
the real essence of what violence really is and does.Yes, sending 
someone into solitary is a way of sending a message to them, 
and to other prisoners. But the act consists largely of stifling 
out the possibility of sending any further messages of any kind. 
It is one thing to say that, when a master whips a slave, he 
is engaging in a form of mean ingf ul, communicative action, 
conveying the need for unquestioning obedience, and at the 
same time trying to create a terrifying mythic image of abso­
lute and arbitrary power. All of this is true. It is quite another 
to insist that that is all that is happening, or all that we need 
to talk about. After all, if we do not go on to explore what 
102 Dead Zones of the Imagination 
"unquestioning" actually means-the master's ability to remain 
completely unaware of the slave's understanding of any situa­
tion, the slave's inability to say anything even when she becomes 
aware of some dire practical flaw in the master's reasoning, the 
forms of blindness or stupidity that result, the fact these oblige 
the slave to devo te even more energy trying to understand and 
anticipate the master's confused percep tions-are we not, in 
however small a way, doing the same work as the whip? It's 
not really about making its victims talk. Ultimately, it's about 
participating in the process that shuts them up. 
There is another reason I began with that story about my 
mother and the notary.As my apparently inexplicable conf usion 
over the signatures makes clear, such dead zones can, temporar­
ily at least, render anybody stupid. Just as, the first time I con­
structed this argument, I was actually unaware that most of these 
ideas had already been dev eloped within feminist standpoint 
theory. That theory itself had been so marginalized I was only 
vaguely aware of it. These territories present us with a kind of 
bureaucratic maze of blindness, ignorance, and absurdity, and 
it is perfectly understandable that decent people seek to avoid 
them-in fact, that the most eff ective strategy of political lib­
eration yet discovered lies precisely in avoiding them-but at 
the same time, it is only at our peril that we simply pretend that 
they're not there.

"Contem porary reality is the beta-version of a science 
fiction dream." -Rich ard Barbrook 
There is a secret shame hovering over all us in the twenty-fir st 
century. No one seems to want to acknowledge it. 
For those in what should be the high point of their lives, in 
their forties and fifties, it is particularly acute, but in a broader 
sense it affects ever yone. The feeling is rooted in a profound 
sense of disappointment about the nature of the world we live 
in, a sense of a broken promise-of a solemn promise we felt 
we were given as children about what our adu lt world was 
supposed to be like. I am referri ng here not to the standard 
false promises that children are always given (about how the 
world is fair, authorities are well-meani ng, or those who work 
hard shall be rewarded), but about a very specific generational 
promise-given above all to those who were children in the 
fifties, sixties, seventies, or even eighties-one that was never 
quite articulated as a promise but rather as a set of assumptions 
105 The Utopia of Rules 
about what our adult world would be like. And since it was 
never quite promis ed, now that it has spect acularly failed to 
come true, we're left confused; indignant, but at the same time, 
embarrassed at our own indignation, ashamed we were ever so 
silly to believe our elders to begin with. 
I am referring, of course, to the conspicuous absence, in 
2or5, of flying cars. 
Well, all right, not just flying cars. I don't really care about 
flying cars -especia lly because I don't even drive. What I have 
in mind are all the technological wonders that any child grow­
ing up in the mid-to-late twentieth century simply assumed 
would exist by 2015. We all know the list: Force fields. Telepor­
tatio n.Antigravity fields. Tricorders. Tractor beams. Immortality. 
drugs. Suspended animation .Androids. Colonies on Mars.What 
happened to them? Every now and then it's widely trumpeted 
that one is about to materialize -clones, for instance, or cryo­
genics, or anti-aging medications, or invisibility cloaks-but 
when these don't prove to be false promis es, which they usually 
are, they emerge hopelessly flawed. Point any of this out, and 
the usual response is a ritual invo cation of the wonders of com­
pute rs-why would you want an antigravity sled when you 
can have second life?-as if this is some sort of unanticipated 
compensation. But, even here, we're not nearly where people in 
the fifties imagined we'd have been by now. We still don't have 
computers you can have an interesting conversation with, or 
robots that can walk the dog or fold your laundry. 
Speaking as someone who was eight years old at the time 
of the Apollo moon landing, I have very clear memories of 
calculating that I would be thirty-nine years of age in the magic 
year 2000, and wondering what the world around me would be 
like. Did I honestly expect I would be living in a world of such 
wonders? Of course. Everyone did. And so do I feel cheated 
now? Absol utely. Certa inly, I didn't think I'd see all the things 
we read about in science fiction realized in my lifetime (even 
106 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
assuming my lifetime was not extended by centuries by some 
newly discovered longevity drug) . If you asked me at the time, 
I'd have guessed about half. But it never occurred to me that I 
wouldn't see any of them. 
I have long been puzzled and fascinated by the near silence 
surrounding this issue in public discourse. One does occasion­
ally see griping about flying cars on the Internet, but it's muted, 
or very marginal. For the most part, the topic is treated almost as 
taboo.At the turn of the millennium, for instance, I was expect­
ing an outpouring of reflections by forty-somethings in the 
popular media on what we had exp ected the world of 2000 to 
be like, and why we had all gotten it so wrong. I couldn't find a 
single one. Instead ,just about all the authoritative voices-both 
Left and Right-b egan their reflections from the assumption 
that a world of technological wonders had, in fact, arrived. 
To a very large extent, the silence is due to fear of being 
ridiculed as foolishly naive. Certainly if one does raise the issue, 
one is likely to hear responses like "Oh, you mean all that Jet­
son stuff?" As if to say, but that was just for children! Surely, 
as grown -ups, we're supposed to understand that the Jetsons 
future was about as realistic as the Flintstones past. But of course 
it wasn't just the Jetsons. All serious science shows designed 
for children in the fifti es, sixties, sevent ies, and even the eight­
ies-the Scientific Americans, the educational TV programs, the 
planetarium shows in national museum s--all the authoritative 
voices who told us what the universe was like and why the sky 
was blue, who explai ned the periodic table of elements , also 
assured us that the future was indeed going to involve colonies 
on other planets, robots, matter transfo rmation devi ces, and a 
world much closer to Star Trek than to our own. 
The fact that all these voices turned out to be wrong doesn't 
just create a deep feeling of largely inexpressible betrayal ; it 
also points to some conceptual problems about how we should 
even talk about history, now that things haven't unfolded as 
107 The Utopia of Rules 
we thought they would. There are contexts where we really 
can't just wave our hands and make the discrepancy between 
exp ectations and reality go away. One obvious one is science 
fiction. Back in the twentieth century, creators of science fic­
tion movies used to come up with concrete dates in which to 
place their futuristic fantasies. Often these were no more than 
a generation in the future. Thus in 1968, Stanley Kubrick felt 
that a moviegoing audience would find it perfectly natural to 
assume that only thirty-three years later, in 2oor, we would have 
commercial moon flights, city-like space stations, and comput­
ers with humanlike personalities maintaining astronauts in sus­
pended animation while traveling to Jupiter.78 In fact about the 
only new technology from 2001 that actually did appear were 
video telephones, but those were already technically possible 
in 1968-at the time, they were simply unmarketable because 
no one really wanted to have one.79 Similar problems crop up 
whenever a particular writer, or program, tries to create a grand 
mythos. According to the universe created by Larry Niven, 
which I got to know as a teenager, humans in this decade (20ros) 
are living under a one-world UN. government and creating 
their first colony on the moon, while dealing with the social 
consequences of medical advances that have created a class of 
immortal rich people. In the Star Trek mythos dev eloped around 
the same time, in contrast, humans would now be recovering 
from fighting off the rule of genetically engineered supermen 
in the Eugenics Wars of the l99os-a war which ended when 
we shot them all in suspension pods into outer space. Star Trek 
writers in the 1990s were thus forced to start playing around 
with alternate time lines and realities just as a way of keeping 
the whole premise from falling apart. 
By 1989, when the creators of Back to the Future II dutifully 
placed flying cars and antigravity hoverboards in the hands of 
ordinary teenagers in the year 2015, it wasn't clear if it was meant 
as a serious prediction, a bow to older traditions of imagined 
' futures, or as a slightly bitter joke. At any rate, it marke d one 
108 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
of the last instances of this sort of thing. Later science fiction 
futures were largely dystopian, moving from bleak technofas­
cism into some kind of stone-age barbarism, as in Cloud Atlas, 
or else, studiously ambiguous: the writers remaining coy about 
the dates, which renders "the future" a zone of pure fantasy, no 
different really than Middle Earth or Cimmeria. They might 
even, as with Star Wars, place the future in the past, "a long time 
ago in a galaxy far, far away." This Future is, most often, not 
really a future at all, but more like an alternative dimension, a 
dream-time, some kind of technological Elsewhere, existing in 
days to come in the same sense that elves and dragon-s]ayers 
existed in the past; just another screen for the project ion of 
moral dramas and mythic fantasi es. Science fiction has now 
become just another set of costumes in which one can dress 
up a We stern, a war movie, a horror flick, a spy thriller, or just 
a fairy tale. 
I think it would be wrong, however, to say that our culture has 
completely sidestepped the issue of technological disappoint­
ment. Embarrassment over this issue has ensured that we've 
been reluctant to engage with it expl icitly. Instead, like so many 
other cultural traumas, pain has been displaced; we can only 
talk about it when we think we're talking about something else. 
In retros pect, it seems to me that entire fin de siecle cultural 
sensibility that came to be referred to as "postmodernism" might 
best be seen as just such a prolonged meditation on technologi­
cal changes that never happened. The thought first struck me 
when watching one of the new Star Ylilrs movi es. The movie 
was awful. But I couldn't help but be impressed by the quality 
of the special effects. Recalling all those clumsy effects typical 
of fifties sci-fi films, the tin spaceships being pulled along by 
almost-invisible strings, I kept thinking about how impressed 
a 1950 s audience would have been if they'd known what we 
could do by now-o nly to immediately realize, "actually, no. 
109 The Utopia of Rules 
They wouldn't be impressed at all, would they? They thought 
that we'd actually be doing this kind of thing by now. Not just 
figuring out more sophisticated ways to simulate it:' 
That last word, "simulate," is key. What technological 
progress we have seen since the seventies has largely been in 
information technologies-that is, technologies of simulation. 
They are technologies of what Jean Baudrillard and Umberto 
Eco used to call the "hyper-real"-the ability to make imita­
tions more realistic than the original. The entire postmodern 
sensibility , the feeling that we had somehow broken into an 
unpr ecedented new historical period where we understood 
that there was nothing new; that grand historical narratives of 
progress and liberation were meaningless; that everything now 
was simulation, ironic repetition, fragmentation and pastiche : 
all this only makes sense in a technological enviro nment where 
the only major breakthroughs were ones making it easier to 
create, transfer, and rearrange virtual projections of things that 
either already existed, or, we now came to realize, never really 
would. Sure ly, if we were really taking our vacations in geodesic 
domes on Mars, or toting about pocket-size d nuclear fusion 
plants or telekinetic mind-reading devi ces, no one would ever 
have been talking like this . The "postmodern" moment was 
simply a desp erate way to take what could only otherwise be 
felt as a bitter disapp ointment, and dress it up as something 
epochal, exciting and new. 
It's worthy of note that in the earliest formulations of post­
modernism, which largely came out of the Marxist traditi on, 
a lot of this technological subtext was not even subtext; it was 
quite expl icit. Here's a passage from Frederick Jameson's origi­
nal Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, in 1984: 
110 It is appropriate to recall the excitement of machinery 
in the moment of capital preceding our own, the exhil­
aration of futurism, most nota bly, and of Marinetti's Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
celebration of the machine gun and the motorcar.These 
are still visible emblems, sculptural nodes of energy 
which give tangibility and figuration to the motive 
energies of that earlier moment of modernization ... 
the ways in which revolutionary or communist artists 
of the 1930s also sought to reappropriate this excite­
ment of machine energy for a Promethean reconstruc­
tion of human society as a whole ... 
It is immediately obvious that the technology of our 
own moment no longer possesses this same capacity for 
repr esentation: not the turbine, nor even Sheeler's grain 
elevators or smokestacks, not the baroque elaboration 
of pipes and conveyor belts, nor even the strea mlined 
profile of the railroad train-al l vehicles of speed still 
concentrated at rest-but rather the computer, whose 
outer shell has no emblematic or visual power, or even 
the casings of the various media themselves, as with 
that home appliance called television which articulates 
nothing but rather implodes, carrying its flattened 
image surface within itself. 80 
Where once the sheer physical power of technologies them­
selves gave us a sense of history sweeping forward , we are now 
reduced to a play of screens and imag es. 
Jameson originally proposed the term "postrnodernism" to 
refer to the cultural logic appropriate to a new phase of capital­
ism, one that Ernest Mandel had, as early as 1972, dubbed a "third 
technological revolution." Humani ty, Mandel argued, stood on 
the brink of a transformation as profound as the agricultural 
or industrial revolutions had been: one in which computers, 
robots, new energy sources, and new information technologies 
would, effectively, replace old-fashioned industrial labor-the 
"end of work" as it soon came to be called-reducing us all to 
designers and computer technicians coming up with the crazy 
111 The Utopia of Rules 
visions that cyb ernetic factories would actually produce.81 End 
' of work arguments became increasingly popular in the late 
seventies and early eigh ties, as radical thinkers pondered what 
would happen to traditional working-class struggle once there 
was no longer a working class. (The answ er: it would turn into 
identity politic s.) 
Jameson thought of himself as exploring the forms of con­
sciousness and historical sensibilities likely to emerge from this 
emerging new age. Of course, as we all know, these techno­
logical breakthroughs did not, actuall y, happ en. What happened 
instead is that the spread of information technologies and new 
ways of organizing transport-the containerization of shipping, 
for example-allowed those same industrial jobs to be out­
sourced to East Asia, Latin America, and other countries where 
the avai lability of cheap labor generally allowed manufacturers 
to employ much less technologically sophisticated production­
line techniques than they would have been obliged to employ at 
home. True, from the perspec tive of those living in Europe and 
North America, or even Japan, the results did seem superficially 
to be much as predicted. Smokestack industries did increasingly 
disa ppear; jobs came to be divided between a lower stratum 
of service workers and an upper stratum sitting in antiseptic 
bubbles playing with computers. But below it all lay an uneasy 
aware ness that this whole new post-work civilization was, 
basic ally, a fraud. Our carefully engineered high-tech sneakers 
were not really being produced by intelligent cyborgs or self ­
replicating molecular nanotechnology; they were being made 
on the equivalent of old-fashioned Singer sewing machines, by 
the daughters of Mexican and Indonesian farmers who had, 
as the result ofWTO or NAFTA -sponsored trade deals, been 
ousted from their ancestral lands. It was this guilty aware ness, it 
seems to me, that ultimately lay behind the postmodern sensi­
bility, its celebration of the endless play of images and surf aces, 
and its insistence that ultimatel y, all those modernist narratives 
112 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
that were supposed to give those images depth and reality had 
been proved to be a lie. 
So: Why did the pro jected explosion of technological growth 
everyone was expecting-the moon bases, the robot factories­
fail to materialize? Logically, there are only two possibili ties. 
Either our expectations about the pace of technological change 
were unrealistic, in which case, we need to ask ourselves why 
so many otherwise intelligent people felt they were not. Or our 
expectations were not inh erently unrealistic, in which case, we 
need to ask what ha ppened to throw the path of technolo l$ical . 
development off course. 
When cultural analysts nowadays do consider the ques­
tion-wh ich they rarely do-they invariably choose the first 
option. One common approach is to trace the problem back 
to illusions created by the Cold War space race. Why; many 
have asked, did both the United States and the Soviet Union 
become so obsessed with the idea of manned space travel in 
the fifties, sixties, and seventies? It was never an efficient way 
to engage in scientific resear ch. Was it not the fact that both 
the Americans and Russians had been, in the century before, 
societies of pioneers, the one expanding across the We stern 
frontier, the other, across Siberia? Was it not the same shared 
commitment to the myth of a limitless , expansive future, of 
human colonization of vast empty spaces, that helped convince 
the leaders of both superpowers they had entered into a new 
"space age" in which they were ultimately battling over control 
over the future itself? And did not that battle ultimate produce, 
on both sides, completely unre alistic conceptions of what that 
future would actually be like?" 
Obviously there is truth in this. There were powerful myths 
at play. But most great human projects are rooted in some kind 
of mythic vision-this, in itself, proves nothing, one way or the 
113 The Utopia of Rules 
other, about the feasibility of the project itself. In this essay, I 
want to explore the second possibili ty. It seems to me there are 
good reasons to believe that at least some of those visions were 
not inherently unrealistic-and that at least some of these sci­
enc,e fiction fantasies (at this point we can't know which ones) 
could indeed have been brought into being. The most obvious 
reason is because in the past, they regularly had been. After all, 
if someone growing up at the turn of the century reading Jules 
Verne or H. G. Wells tried to imagine what the world would 
be like in, say, r960, they imagined a world of flying machines, 
rocket ships, submarines, new forms of energy, and wireless 
communication ... and that was pretty much exactly what they 
got. If it wasn't unrealistic in 1900 to dream of men traveling 
to the moon, why was it unrealistic in the sixties to dream of 
jet-packs and rob ot laundry-maids? If from I7?0 to r950 new 
power sources emerged regularly (steam, electric, petroleum, 
nuclear ... ) was it that unreasonable to imagine we'd have seen 
at least one new one since? 
There is reason to believe that even by the fifties and sixties, 
the real pace of technological innovation was beginning to slow 
from the heady pace of the first half of the century. There was 
something of a last spate ofinventions in the fif ties when micro­
wave ovens (r954), the pill (r957), and lasers (1958) all appeared 
in rapid succession. But since then, most apparent technological 
advances have largely taken the form of either clever new ways 
of combining existing technologies (as in the space race), or 
new ways to put existing technologies to consumer use (the 
most famous example here is television, inve nted in 1926, but 
only mass-prod uced in the late forties and early fifties, in a self­
conscious effort to create new consumer demand to ensure the 
American economy didn't slip back into depression) . Yet the 
space race help ed con vey the notion that this was an age of 
remarkable adva nces, and the predominant popular impression 
during the sixties was that the pace of technological change was 
114 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
speeding up in terrifying, uncontrollable ways. Alvin Toffler's 
1970 breaka way bestseller Future Shock can be seen as a kind 
of high-water mark of this line of thought. In retro spect, it's a 
fascinating and revealing book." 
Toffler argued that almost all of the social problems of the 
1960s could be traced back to the increasing pace of tech­
nological change. As an endless outpouring of new scientific 
breakthroughs cont inually transformed the very grounds of our 
daily existe nce, he wrote, Americans were left rudderless, with­
out any clear idea of what normal life was supposed to be like. 
Perhaps it was most obvious in the case of the family, where, 
he claimed, not just the pill, but also the prosp ect of in vitro 
fertili zation, test tube babies, and sperm and egg donation were 
about to make the very idea of motherho od obsolete. Toffler 
saw similar things happening in every domain of social lif e­
nothing could be taken for gran ted. And humans were not psy­
chologically prepared for the pace of change. He coined a term 
for the phenomenon: "acce lerative thrust." This quickening of 
the pace of technological advance had begun, perhaps, with the 
industrial revolution, but by roughly 1850, he argued, the effect 
had become unmistakable. Not only was everything around us 
changing, most of it-the sheer mass of human knowledge, the 
size of the population, industrial grow th, the amount of energy 
being consumed -was changing at an exponential rate. Toffler 
insisted that the only solution was to begin to create some kind 
of democratic control over the process -institutions that could 
assess emerging technologies and the effects they were likely to 
have, ban those technologies likely to be too socially disruptive, 
and guide development in dire ctions that would foster social 
harmo ny. 
The fascinating thing is that while many of the historical 
trends Toffler describes are accurate, the book itself appeared at 
almost precisely the moment when most of them came to an 
end. For instance, it was right around 1970 when the increase 
115 The Utopia of Rules 
in the number of scientific papers published in the world-a 
figure that had been doubling every fifteen years since roughly 
1685-began leveling off. The same is true of the number of 
books and patents. In other areas, growth did not just slow 
down-it stopped entirely. Toffier's choice of the word "accel­
eration" turns out to have been particularly unfortunate. For 
most of human history, the top speed at which human beings 
could travel had lingered around twenty-five miles per hour. By 
1900 it had increased to perhaps IOO mph, and for the next sev­
enty years it did indeed seem to be increasing expone ntially. By 
the time Toffier was writing, in 1970, the record for the fastest 
speed at which any human had trav eled stood at 24, 791 mph, 
achieved by the crew of Apollo IO while reentering the earth's 
atmosphere in 1969, just a year before. At such an exponential 
rate, it must have seemed reasonable to assume that within a 
matter of decades, humanity would be exploring other solar 
systems. Yet no further increase has occurred since 1970. The 
record for the fastest a human has ever trav eled remains with 
the crew of Apollo IO. True, the maximum speed of commer­
cial air flight did peak one year later, at 14,000 mph, with the 
launching of the Concorde in l97L But airline speed has not 
only failed to increase since-it has actually decreased since the 
Concorde' s abandonment in 2003.84

The fact that Toffier turned out to be wrong about almost 
everything had no deleterious effects on his own career. Char­
ismatic prophets rarely suffer much when their prophecies fail 
116 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
to materialize. Toff!er just kept retooling his analysis and com­
ing up with new spectacular pronouncements every decade or 
so, always to great public recognition and applause. In 1980 he 
produced a book called The Third Wave, 86 its argument lifted 
directly from Ernest Mandel's "third technological revolu­
tion"-except that while Mandel argued these changes would 
spell the eventual end of capitalism, Toff!er simply assumed that 
capitalism would be around forever. By 1990, he had become 
the personal intellectual guru of Republican congressman 
Newt Gingrich, who claimed that his own 1994 "Contract 
with America" was inspired, in part, by the understanding that 
the United States needed to move from an antiquated, materi­
alist, industrial mindset to a new, free-market, information-age, 
Third Wave civilization. 
There are all sorts of iron ies here. Probably one of the great­
est real-world achievements of Future Shock had been to inspire 
the gov ernment to create an Office ofT echnology Assessment 
(OTA) in 1972, more or less in line with Toff!er' s call for some 
sort of democratic oversight over potentially disruptive tech­
nologies. One of Gingrich's first acts on winning control of 
Congress in 1995 was to defund the OTA as an example of 
useless government waste. Again, none of this seemed to faze 
Toff! er at all. By that time, he had long since given up try­
ing to influence policy by appealing to the general public, or 
even really trying to influence political debate; he was, instead, 
making a living largely Sy giving seminars to GEOs and the 
denizens of corporate think tanks. His insights had, effectively, 
been privatized. 
Gingrich liked to call himself a "con servative futurologis t:' 
This might seem oxymoron ic; but actu ally, if you look back at 
Toff!er's work in retrosp ect, the guru's politics line up precisely 
with his student's, and it's rather surprising anyone ever took 
him for anything else. The argument of Future Shock is the 
very definition of conservatism. Progress was always presented 
117 The Utopia of Rules 
as a problem that needed to be solve d. True, his solution was 
ostensibly to create forms of democratic control, but in effect, 
"democratic" obviously meant "bureaucratic," the creation of 
panels of experts to determine which inventions would be 
approved, and which put on the shelf. In this way, Toffier might 
best be seen as a latter day, intellectually lightweight version of 
the early nineteenth-century social theorist Auguste Comte. 
Comte, too, felt that he was standing on the brink of a new 
age--in his case, the industrial age--driven by the inexorable 
progress of technolog y, and that the social cataclysms of his 
times were really caused by the social system not having man­
aged to adjust. The older, feudal order, had dev eloped not only 
Catholic theology; a way of thinking about man's place in the 
cosmos perfectly suited to the social system of the time, but an 
institutional structure, the Church, that conveyed and enforced 
such ideas in a way that could give every one a sense of mean­
ing and belonging. The current, industrial age had develo ped 
its own system of ideas-science--but scientists had not suc­
ceeded in creating anything like the Catholic Chur ch. Comte 
concluded that we needed to develop a new science, which he 
dubbed "socio logy;' and that sociologists should play the role 
of priests in a new Religion of Society that would inspire the 
masses with a love of order , com munity, work-discipline, and 
patriarchal family values. Toffier was less ambitious: his futur­
ologists were not supposed to actually play the role of priests. 
But he shared the same feeling that technology was leading 
humans to the brink of a great historical break, the same fear of 
social breakdown, and, for that matter, the same obsession with 
the need to preserve the sacred role of motherhood-Comte 
wanted to put the image of a pregnant woman on the flag of 
his religious move ment. 
Gingrich did have another guru who was overtly religious: 
George Gilder, a libertarian theologian, and author, among other 
things, of a newsletter called the "Gilder Technology Report." 
118 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
Gilder was also obsessed with the relation of technology and 
social change, but in an odd way, he was far more optimistic. 
Embracing an even more radical version of Mandel's Third 
Wave argument, he insisted that what we were seeing since the 
r97os with the rise of computers was a veritable "overthrow 
of matter:' The old, materialis t, industrial society , where value 
came from physical labor, was giving way to an information age 
where value emerged directly from the minds of entrepr eneurs, 
just as the world had origina lly appeared ex nihilo from the 
mind of God, just as money, in a proper supply-side econom y, 
emerged ex nihilo from the Federal Reserve and into the hands 
of creative, value-creating, capitalists. Supply-side economic 
policies, he concluded, would ensure that inve stment would 
continue to steer away from old gove rnment boondoggles like 
the space program, and towards more productive information 
and medical technologies. 
Gilder, who had begun his career declaring that he aspired 
to be "America's premier antifeminist," also insisted that such 
salutary developments could only be maintained by strict 
enforcement of traditional family va lues. He did no.t propose a 
new religion of socie ty. He didn't feel he had to, since the same 
work could be done by the Christian evangelical movement 
that was already forging its strange alliance with the libertarian 
right.87 
One would be unwise, perhaps, to dwell too much on such 
eccentric characters, however influential. For one thing, they 
came very late in the day. If there was a conscious, or semi­
conscious, move away from investment in research that might 
have led to better rockets and robots, and towards research that 
would lead to such things as laser printers and CAT scans, it 
had already begun before the appearance of To flier's Future 
Shock (1971), let alone Gilder's l#alth and Poverty (r98r)." What 
119 The Utopia of Rules 
their success does show is that the issues these men raised-the 
concern that existing patterns of technological development 
would lead to social upheaval, the need to guide technologi­
cal devel opment in directions that did not challenge existing 
structures of authority- found a recept ive ear in the very high­
est corridors of power. There is every reason to believe that 
statesmen and captains of industry were indeed thinking about 
such questions, and had been for some time." 
So what happened? Over the course of the rest of this 
essay, which is divided into three parts, I am going to consider 
a number of factors that I think contributed to ensuring the 
technological futures we all anticipated never happened. These 
fall into two broad groups. One is broadly political, having to 
do with conscious shifts in the allocation of research funding; 
the other bureaucratic, a change in the nature of the systems 
administering scientific and technological research. 
Thesis 
There appears to have been a profound shift, be ginnin g in the 1970 s, 
from inves tment in techno logies associated with the possibility of 
alternative futures to investment technologies that furthered labor 
discipline and social control 
120 "The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolu­
tionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the 
relati ons of production, and with them the whole rela­
tions of society ... All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with 
their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opin­
ions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become anti­
quated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into 
air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled 
to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his 
relations with his kind." 
-Marx and Engels, Manifesto efthe Communist Party (1847) Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
"I said that fun was very imp ortant, too, that it was a direct 
rebuttal of the kind of ethics and morals that were being 
put forth in the country to keep people working in a rat 
race which didn't make any sense because in a few years 
the machines would do all the work anyway, that there 
was a whole system of values that people were taught 
to postpone their pleasure, to put all their money in the 
bank, to buy life insurance, a whole bunch of things that 
didn't make any sense to our generation at all." 
-Ab bie Hoffman, from the trial of the Chicago Seven (1970) 
Since its inception in the eighteenth century , the system that 
has come to be known as "industrial capitalism" has fostered 
an extremely rapid rate of scientific advance and technological 
innovation-one unparalleled in previ ous human histo ry. Its 
advocates have always held this out as the ultimate justification 
for the exploitation, misery, and destruction of communities 
the system also produced. Even its most famous detractors, Karl 
Marx and Friedrich Engels, were willing to celebrate capital­
ism-if for nothing else-for its magnificent unleashing of the 
"productive forces." Marx and Engels also believed that that 
very tendency, or, to be more precise, capitalism's very need to 
continually revolutionize the means of industrial production, 
would eventually be its undoing. 
Is it possible that they were right? And is it also possible that 
in the sixties, capitalists, as a class, began to figure. this out? 
Marx's specific argument was that, for certain technical 
reasons, value, and therefore profits, can only be extra cted from 
human labor. Competition forces factory owners to mechanize 
production, so as to reduce labor costs, but while this is to the 
short-term advantage of the individual firm, the overall effect 
of such mechanization is actually to drive the overall rate of 
profit of all firms down. For almost two centuries now, econo­
mists have debated whether all this is really true. But if it is true, 
121 The Utopia of Rules 
the otherwise mysterious decision by industrialists not to pour 
research funds into the inven tion of the robot factories that 
everyone was anticipating in the sixties, and instead to begin to 
relocate their factories to more labor-intensive, low-tech facili­
ties in China or the Global South, makes perfect sense.90 
I've already observed that there's reason to believe the pace 
of technological innovation in productive processes-the facto­
ries themselves-had already begun to slow down consid erably 
in the fifties and sixties. Obviously it didn't iook that way at 
the time. What made it appear otherwise were largely the side­
effects of U.S. rivalry with the Soviet Union.This seems to have 
been true in two ways. One was a conscious policy: the Cold 
War saw frenetic efforts by U.S. industrial planners" to find 
ways to apply existing technologies to consumer purposes, to 
create an optimistic sense of burgeoning prosperity and guar­
anteed progress that, it was hoped, would undercut the appeal 
of radical working-class politics. The famous 1959 "kitchen 
debate" between Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev made 
the politics quite expl icit: "your communist 'worker's state' may 
have beat us into outer space;' Nixon effectively argued, "but 
it's capitalism that creates technology like washing machines 
that actually improve the lives of the toiling mass es:' The other 
was the space race. In either case, the initiative really came from 
the Soviet Union itself. All this is difficult for Americans to 
remember, because with the end of the Cold War, the popular 
image of the USSR switched so quickly from terrifying rival to 
pathetic basket case-the exemplar of a society that "just didn't 
work." Back in the fif ties, many U.S. planners were laboring 
under the suspicion that the Soviet system quite poss ibly worked 
much better than their own. Certain ly, they keenly recalled the 
fact that in the 1930s, while the United States was mired in 
depression, the Soviet Union was maintaining almost unprec­
edented economic growth rates of IO to 12 percent a year-an 
achievement quickly followed by the production of the vast 
122 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
tank arnl ies that defeated Hitler, and of course, the launching 
of Sputnik in 1957, followed by the first manned space craft, the 
Vostok, in 196r. When Khrushchev assured Nixon that Soviet 
living standards would surpass those of the Americans in seven 
years, many Americans feared he nlight actuall y be right. 
It's often said that the Apollo moon landing was the great­
est historical achievement of Soviet communism. Surel y, the 
United States would never have contemplated such a feat had 
it not been for the cosnlic ambitions of the Soviet Politburo. 
Even putting things this way is a bit startling. "Cosmic ambi­
tions?" We are used to thinking of the Politburo as a group of 
unimagina tive grey bureaucrats, but while the Soviet Union 
was certa inly run by bureaucrats, they were, from the begin­
ning, bureaucrats who dare d to dream astounding dreams. (The 
dream of world revolution was just the first .) Of course, most of 
their grandiose proj ects-changing the course of nlighty rive rs, 
that sort of thing -either turned out to be ecologically and 
socially disastrous, or, like Stalin's projected one-hundred-story 
Palace of the Soviets, which was to be topp ed by a twenty-story 
statue of Lenin, never got off the ground. And after the initial 
successes of the Soviet space program, most projects remained 
on the drawing board. But the Soviet leadership never ceased 
coming up with new ones. Even in the eighties, when the 
United States was attempting its own last-itself abor tive­
grandiose scheme, Star Wars, the Soviets were still planning and 
scheming ways to transform the world through creative uses 
of technology. Few outside of Russia now remem ber most of 
these projects, but vast resources were devoted to them. It's also 
worth noting that unlike the Star Wars project, which was a 
purely military project designed to sink the Soviet Union, most 
were peaceful: as for instance, the attempt to solve the world 
hunger problem by harvesting lakes and oceans with an edible 
bacteria called spirulina, or to solve world energy problems by 
a truly breathtaking plan to launch hundreds of gigantic solar 
123 The Utopia of Rules 
power platforms into orbit and beaming the resulting electric­
ity back to earth.92 
Even the golden age of science fiction, which had its heyday 
in the fifties and sixti es, and which first dev eloped that standard 
repertoire of future inventions-force fields, tractor beams, warp 
drives-that any contemporary eight-year-old is familiar with 
(just as surely as they will know that garlic, crosses, stak es, and 
sunlight are what's most likely to be of help in slaying vampires) 
occurred in the United States and the USSR simultaneously." 
Or consider Star Trek, that quinte ssence of American mythol­
ogy. Is not the Federation of Planets-with its high-minded 
idealism, strict military discipline, and apparent lack of both 
class diff erences and any real evidence of multiparty democ­
racy-really just an Americanized vision of a kinder, gentler 
Soviet Union, and above all, one that actually "worke d"?" 
What I find remarkable about Star Trek, in particular, is that 
there is not only no real evidence of democracy, but that almost 
no one seems to notice its absence. Granted, the Star Trek uni­
verse has been endlessly elaborated, with multip le series, movies, 
books and comics, even encyclopedias, not to mention decades' 
worth of every sort of fan fiction, so the question of the politi­
cal constitution of the Federation did eventually have to come 
up. And when it did there was no real way anyone could say 
it was not a democracy. So one or two late references to the 
Federation as having an elected President and legislature were 
duly thrown in. But this i.s meaningless. Signs of real democratic 
life are entirely absent in the show-no character ever makes 
even a passing reference to elections, political parties, divisive 
issues, opinion polls, slogans, plebiscites, protests, or campaigns. 
Does Federat ion " democracy" even operate on a party system? 
If so, what are the parties? What sort of philosophy or core 
constituency does each repre sent? In 726 episodes we're not 
given the slightest clue. 95 
One might object: the characters themselves are part of 
124 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
Star Fleet. They're in the military. True; but in real democratic 
societies, or even constitutional republics like the United States, 
soldiers and sailors regularly express political opinions about 
all sorts of things.You never see anyone in Star Fleet saying, "I 
never should have voted for those idiots pushing the expan­
sionist policy , now look what a mess they've gotten into in 
Sector 5" or "when I was a student I was active in the campaign 
to ban terraf orming of class-C planets but now I'm not sure we 
were right!'When political problems do arise, and they regularly 
do, those sent in to deal with them are invariably bureaucra ts, 
diplomats , and officials. Star Trek characters complain about 
bureaucrats all the time. They never complain about politicians. 
Because political problems are always addressed solely through 
administrative means.96 
But this is of course exactly what one would expect under 
some form of state socia lism. We tend to forget that such regimes, 
also, invariably claimed to be democracies. On paper, the USSR 
under Stalin boasted an exemplary constitution, with far more 
democratic controls than European parliamentary systems of 
the time. It was just that, much as in the Federation, none of this 
had any bearing on how life actually worked. 
The Federation, then, is Leninism brought to its full and 
absolute cosmic success--{( society where secret police, reedu­
cation camps, and show trials are not necessary because a happy 
con juncture of material abundance and ideological conf ormity 
ensures the system can now run entirely by itself. · 
While no one seems to know or much care about the 
Federation's political composition, its economic system has, 
from the eighties onward, been subject to endless curiosity 
and debate. Star Trek characters live under a regime of explicit 
communism. Social classes have been eliminated. So too have 
divisions based on race, gender, or ethnic origin." The very 
existence of mon ey, in earlier periods, is considered a weird and 
somewhat amusing historical curiosi ty. Menial labor has been 
125 The Utopia of Rules 
automated into nonexi stence. Floors clean themselves. Food, 
clothing, tools and weapons can be whisked into exis tence at 
will with a mere expenditure of energy, and even energy does 
not seem to be. rationed in any significant way. All this did raise 
some hackles, and it would be interesting to write a politi­
cal history of the debate over the economics of the future it 
sparked in the late eighties and early nineties. I well remember 
watching filmmaker Michael Moore, in a debate with editors 
of The Nation, pointing out that Star Trek showed that ordinary 
working-class Americans were far more amenable to overt 
anticapitalist politics than the beacons of the mainstream "pro­
gressive" left. It was around that time, too, that conser vatives 
and libertarians on the Internet also began to take notice, filling 
newsgroups and other electronic forums with condemnations 
of the show as leftist propagand a." But sudden ly, we learned that 
money had not entirely disappeared. There was latinum. Those 
who traded in it, however, were an odious race who seemed to 
be almost exactly modeled on Medieval Christian stereotypes 
of Jews, except with oversized ears instead of oversized noses. 
(Amusing ly, they were given a name, Ferengi, that is actually the 
Arabic and Hindi term for "annoying white person.")" On the 
other hand, the suggestion that the Federation was promoting 
communism was undercut by the intro duction of the Borg, a 
hostile civilization so utterly communistic that individuality 
had been effaced complet ely, sucking any sentient life form it 
assimilated into one terrifying beehive mind. 
By the time of the moon landing of 1968, U.S. planners no 
longer took their competition serio usly. The Soviets had lost 
the space race, and as a result, the actual direction of American 
research and development could shift away from anything that 
might lead to the creation of Mars bases and robot factories, let 
alone become the technological basis for a communist utopia. 
126 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
The standard line, of course, is that this shift of priorities 
was simply the natural result of the triumph of the market. 
The Apollo program was the quintessential Big Government 
project-Soviet-inspired in the sense that it required a vast 
national effort, coordinated by an equally vast government 
bureaucracy. As soon as the Soviet threat was safely ou.t of the 
picture, this story goes, capitalism was free to revert to lines 
of technological development more in accord with its nor­
mal, decentral ized, free-market imperatives -such as privately 
funded research into marketabl e products like touch-pad 
phones, adventurous little start-up s, and the like. This is, cer­
tain ly, the line that men like Toffier and Gilder began taking in 
the late seventies and early eight ies. But it's obviously wrong. 
First of all, the amount of really innovative research being 
done in the private sector has actually declined since the 
heyday of Bell Labs and similar corporate research divisions 
in the fifties and sixties. Partly this is because of a change 
of tax regimes. The phone company was willing to invest 
so much of its profits in research because those profits were 
highly taxed-given the choice between sinking the money 
into higher wages for its workers (which bought loyalty) and 
research (which made sense to a company that was still locked 
in the old mind-set that said corporations were ultimately 
about making things, rather than making money) , and hav­
ing that same money simply approp riated by the government, 
the choice was obvious. After the changes in the seventies 
and eighties described in the introduction, all this changed. 
Corporate taxes were slashed. Executives, whose compensa­
tion now increasingly took the form of stock options, began 
not just paying the profits to inve stors in divi dends, but using 
money that would otherwise be direc ted towards raises, hiring, 
or research budgets on stock buybac ks, raising the values of the 
executives' portfolios but doing nothing to further productiv­
ity. In other words, tax cuts and financial reforms had almost 
127 The Utopia of Rules 
precisely the opposite effect as their proponents claimed they 
would. 
At the same time, the U.S. government never did abandon 
gigantic state-controlled schemes of technological develop­
ment. It just shifted their emphasis sharply away from civilian 
proj ects like the space program and in the direction of military 
research-not just Star Wars, which was Reagan's version of a 
vast Soviet-scale project, but an endless variety of weapons proj ­
ects, research in communications and surveillance technologies, 
and similar, "security-related" concerns. To some degree this 
had always been true: the billions poured into missile research 
alone had always dwarf ed the relatively insignificant sums allo­
cated to the space program. Yet by the 1970s, even much basic 
research came to be conducted following essentially military 
priorities: The most immediate reason we don't have robot 
factories is that, for the last several decades, some 95 percent 
of robotics research funding has been channeled through the 
Pentagon, which is of course has far more inter�sted in the kind 
of discoveries that might lead to the development of unmanned 
drones than full y automated bauxite mines o� rob ot gardeners. 
These military projects did have their own civilian spin-o ffs: 
the Internet is one. But they had the effect of guiding develop­
ment in very specific direc tions. 
One might suggest an even darker possibility.A case could be 
made that even the shift into R&D on information technologies 
and medicine was not so much a reorientation towards market­
driven consumer imperative s, but part of an all-out effort to 
follow the technological humbling of the Soviet Union with 
total victory in the global class war: not only the imposition of 
absolute U.S. military dominance ove rseas, but the utter rout of 
social movements back home. The technologies that emerged 
were in almost every case the kind that proved most conducive 
to surveillan ce, work discipline, and social control. Computers 
have opened up certai� spaces of freedom, as we're constantly 
128 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
reminded, but instead of leading to the workless utopia Abbie 
Hoff man or Guy Debord imagined, they have been employed in 
such a way as to produce the opposite eff ect. Information tech­
nology has allowed a financialization of capital that has driven 
workers ever more desperately into debt, whi le, at the same 
time, allowed employers to create new "flexible" work regimes 
that have destroyed traditional job security and led to a massive 
increase in overall working hours for almost all segments of the 
population. Along with the export of traditional factory jobs, 
tbis has put the union movement to rout and thus destr oyed any 
real possibility of effective working-class politics .100 Meanwhile, 
despite unprecedented investment in research on medicine and 
life sciences, we still await cures for cancer or even of the com­
mon cold; instead, the most dramatic medical breakthroughs we 
have seen have taken the form of drugs like Prozac, Zol oft, or 
Ritalin-tai lor-made, one might say, to ensure that these new 
professional demands don't drive us comple tely, dysfunctional ly, 
crazy. 
When historians write the epitaph for neoliberalism, they 
will have to conclude that it was the form of capitalism that 
systematically prioritized political imperatives over economic 
ones. That is: given a choice between a course of action that 
will make capitalism seem like the only possible economic 
system, and one that will make capitalism actually be a more 
viable long-term economic system, neoliberalism has meant 
always choosing the former. Does destroying job security while 
increasing working hours really create a more productive Qet 
alone innovative, loyal) workfo rce? There is every reason to 
believe that exactly the opposite is the case. In purely economic 
terms the result of neoliberal reform of labor markets is almost 
certainly negativ e--an impression that overall lower economic 
growth rates in just about all parts of the world in the eight­
ies and nineties would tend to reinforce. However it has been 
spectac ularly effective in depoliticizing labor. The same could 
129 The Utopia of Rules 
be said of the burgeoning growth in armies, police, and private 
security servic es. They're utterly unproduct ive-n othing but a 
resource sink. It's quite possible, in fact, that the very weight of 
the apparatus created to ensure the ideological victory of capi­
talism will itself ultimately sink it. But it's also easy to see how, 
if the ultimate imperative of those running the world is chok­
ing off the possibility of any sense of an inevitable, redemptive 
future that will be fundamentally different than the world today 
must be a crucial part of the neoliberal project. 
Antithesis 
Yet even those areas ef sdence and techno logy that did receive massive 
funding have not seen the breakthr oughs originally antidpated 
At this point, the pieces would seem to be falling neatly into 
place. By the 1960s, cons ervative political forces had become 
skittish about the socially disruptive effects of technological 
progress, which they blamed for the social upheavals of the 
era, and employers were beginning to worry about the eco­
nomic impact of mechanization. The fading of the Soviet threat 
allowed for a massive reallocation of resources in directions seen 
as less challenging to social and economic arrangements-and 
ultimat ely, to ones that could support a campaign to sharply 
reverse the gains progressive social movements had made since 
the forties, thus achieving a decisive victory in what U.S. elites 
did indeed see as a global class war. The change of priorities 
was touted as a withdrawal of big-government projects and a 
return to the market, but it actually involved a shif t in the ori­
entation of gov ernment-directed research, away from programs 
like NASA-or, say, alternative energy sources-and toward 
even more intense focus on military, information, and medical 
technologies. 
I think all this is true as far as it goes; but it can't explain 
everything. Above all, it cannot explain why even in those areas 
130 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
that have become the focus of well-funded research projects, 
we have not seen anything like the kind of advan ces anticipated 
fifty years ago. To take only the most obvious exam ple: if 95 
percent of robotics research has been funded by the military, 
why is there still no sign of Klaatu-style killer robots shoot­
ing death rays from their eyes? Because we know they've been 
working on that. 
Obviou sly, there have been advances in military technol ogy. 
It's widely acknowledged that one of the main reasons we all 
survived the Cold War is that while nuclear bombs worked more 
or less as adve rtised, the delivery systems didn't; Intercontinental 
Ballistic Missiles weren't really capable of hitting cities, let alone 
specific targets inside them, which meant there was little point 
in launching a nuclear first strike unless you were consciously 
intending to destroy the world. Contemporary cruise missiles, 
in contrast, are fairly accurate. Still, all those much-vaunted 
precision weapons never seem capable of taking out specific 
individuals (Saddam, Osama, Gadda fi), even if hundreds are 
dropped. Drones are just model airplanes, driven by remote 
control. And ray guns of any sort have not materialized, surely 
not for lack of trying -we have to assume the Pentagon has 
poured billions into coming up with one, but the closest they're 
come so far are lasers (a fifties technology) that might, if aimed 
correc tly, make an enemy gunner looking directly at the beam 
go blind. This is not just unsporting, but rather pathetic. Phasers 
that can be set to stun do not appear to even be on ·the drawing 
boards; in fact, when it comes to infan try combat, the pref erred 
weapon in 2orr, almost everywhere, remains the AK-4 7, a Soviet 
design, named after the year it was first introdu ced: 1947.101 
The same, as I've already noted, can be said of widely 
anticipated breakthroughs in medicine, and even (dare I say?) 
computers. The Internet is surely a remarkable thing. Still, if a 
fifties sci-fi fan were to appear in the present and ask what the 
most dramatic technological achievement of the intervening 
131 The Utopia of Rules 
sixty years had been, it's hard to imagine the reaction would 
have been anything but bitter disappointment. He would 
almost certainly have pointed out that all we are really talking 
about here is a super-fast and globally accessible combination of 
library, post office, and mail order catalog. "Fifty years and this 
is the best our scientists managed to come up with? We were 
expecting computers that could actually think!" 
All this is true, despite the fact that overall levels of research 
funding have increased dramatically since the 1970s. Of course, 
the proportion of that ' funding that comes from the corporate 
sector has increased even more dramat icall y, to the point where 
private enterprise is now funding twice as much research as the 
gove rnment. But the total increase is so large that the overall 
amount of government research funding, in real dollar terms, 
is still much higher than it was before. Again, while "basic," 
"curiosi ty-driven," or"blue skies" research-the kind that is not 
driven by the prosp ect of any immediate practical application, 
and which is therefore most likely to lead to unexpected break­
throughs-is an ever- smaller proportion of the total, so much 
money is being thrown around nowadays that overall levels of 
basic research funding has actually gone up. Yet most honest 
assessments have agreed that the results have been surprisingly 
paltry. Certainly we no longer see any thing like the continual 
stream of conceptual revolutions-genetic inheritance, relativ­
ity, psychoanalysis, quantum mechanics-that humanity had 
grown used to, and even to expect, a hundred years before. 
Why? 
One common explanation is that when funders do conduct 
basic research, they tend to put all their eggs in one gigantic 
basket: "Big Science," as it has come to be called. The Human 
Genome Project is often held out as an exam ple. Initiated by the 
U.S. gove rnment, the project ended up spending almost three 
billion dollars and employing thousands of scientists and staff 
in five diff erent countries, generating enormous exp ectations, 
132 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
only to discover that human gene sequences are nearly identi­
cal to those of chimpanzees, distinctly less complicated than 
the gene seque nce.s of, say, rice, and that there would appear 
to be very little to be learned from them that's of immedi­
ate practical application. Even mor e--a nd I think this is really 
key-the hype and political investment surrounding such proj­
ects demonstrate the degree to which even basic research now 
seems to be driven by political, administrative, and marketing 
imperatives (the Human Genome Project for instance had its 
own corporate-style logo) that make it increasingly unlikely 
that any thing partic ularly revolutio.nary will result. 
Here, I think our collective fascination with the mythic 
origins of Silicon Valley and the Internet have blinded us to 
what's really going on. It has allowed us imagine that research 
and development is now driven, primarily, by small teams of 
plucky entrepreneurs; or the sort of decentralized cooperation 
that creates open-source software. It isn't. These are just the sort 
of research teams most likely to produce results. If any thi!lg, 
research has been moving in the opposite direction. It is still 
driven by giant, bureaucratic proj ects; what has changed is the 
bureaucratic culture. The increasing interpen etration of gov­
ernment, university, and private firms has led all parties to adopt 
language, sensibilities, and organizational forms that originated 
in the corporate world. Wh ile this might have helped some­
what in speeding up the creation of immediately marketable 
products-as tills is what corporate bureaucracies 'are designed 
to do-in terms of fostering original research, the results have 
been catastrophic. 
Here I can speak from experience. My own knowledge 
comes largely from universities, both in the United States and 
the UK. In both countries, the last thirty years have seen a 
veritable explosion of the proportion of working hours spent 
on administrative paperwork, at the expense of pretty much 
every tlllng else. In my own universi ty, for instance, we have not 
133 The Utopia of Rules 
only more administrative staff than facu lty, but the faculty, too, 
are expected to spend at least as much 'time on administrative 
responsibilities as on teaching and research combined.102 This 
is more or less par for the course for universities worldwide. 
The exp losion of paperwork, in turn, is a direct result of the 
intr oduction of corporate management techniques, which are 
always justified as ways of increasing efficiency, by introducing 
competition at every level .What these management techniques 
invariably end up meaning in practice is that everyone winds 
up spending most of their time trying to sell each other things: 
grant proposals; book proposals; assessments of our students' 
job and grant applications; assessments of our colleagues; pro­
spectuses for new interdisciplinary majors, institutes, conf er­
ence works hops, and universities themselv es, which have now 
become brands to be marketed to prospective students or con­
tributors. Marketing and PR thus come to engulf every aspect 
of university life. 
The result is a sea of documents about the fostering of 
"imagination" and "cre ativity," set in an envir onment that might 
as well have been designed to strangle any actual manif estations 
of imagination and creativity in the cradle. I am not a scientist. 
I work in social theory. But I have seen the results in my own 
field of endeavor. No major new works of social theory have 
emerged in the United States in the last thirty years. We have, 
instead, been largely reduced to the equivalent of Medieval 
scholastics, scribbling endless annotations on French theory 
from the 1970s, despite the guilty awareness that if contem­
porary incarnations of Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, or 
even Pierre Bourdieu were to appear in the U.S. academ y, they 
would be unlikely to even make it through grad school, and 
if they somehow did make it, they would almost certainly be 
denied tenure. 103 
There was a time when academia was society's refuge for 
the eccentric, brilliant, and imprac tical. No longer. It is now 
134 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
the domain of prof essional self-marketers. As for the eccentric, 
brilliant, and impractical: it would seem society now has no 
place for them at all. 
If all this is true in the social sciences, where research is 
still carried out largely by individuals, with minimal ove rhead, 
one can only imagine how much worse it is for physicists. And 
indeed, as one physicist has recently warned students pondering 
a career in the sciences, even when one does emerge from the 
usual decade-long period languishing as someone else's flun ky, 
one can expect one's best ideas to be stymied at every point. 
You [will] spend your time writing proposals rather 
than doing research. Wo rse, because your proposals 
are judged by your competitors you cannot follow 
your curiosity , but must spend your eff ort and talents 
on anticipating and deflecting criticism rather than 
on solving the important scientific problems ... It is 
proverbial that original ideas are the kiss of death for 
a proposal; because they have not yet been proved to 
work .104 
That pretty much answers the question of why we don't 
have teleportation devices or antigravity shoes. Common sense 
dictates that if you want to maximize scientific creativity, you 
find some bright people, give them the resources they need to 
pursue whatever idea comes into their heads, and then leave 
them alone for a while. Most will probably turn up nothing, 
but one or two may well discover something completely unex­
pected. If you want to minimize the possibility of unexpected 
breakthroughs, tell those same people they will receive no 
resources at all unless they spend the bulk of their time compet­
ing against each other to convince you they already know what 
they are going to discover. 105 
That's pretty much the system we have now. 106 
135 The Utopia of Rules 
In the natural sciences, to the tyranny of managerialism we 
can also add the creeping privatization of research results. As 
the British economist David Harvie has recently reminded us, 
"open source" research is not new. Scholarly research has always 
been open-source in the sense that scholars share materials and 
results. There is competition, certainly, but it is, as he nicely puts 
it, ''con vivial '': 
Convivial competition is where I (or my team) wish to 
be the first to prove a particular conjecture, to explain 
a particular phenomenon, to discover a particular spe­
cies, star or particle, in the same way that if I race my 
bike against my friend I wish to win. But convivial 
competition does not exclude coo peration, in that 
rival researchers (or research teams) will share pre­
liminary results, experience of techniques and so on ... 
Of course, the shared knowledge, accessible through 
books, article s, computer softwa re and directl y, through 
dialogue with other scientists, forms an intellectual 
commons.101 
Obviously this is no longer true of scientists working in the 
corporate sector, where findings are jealously guarded, but the 
spread of the corporate ethos within the academy and research 
institutes themselves has increasingly caused even publicly 
funded scholars to treat their findings as personal prope rty. Less 
is published. Academic publishers ensure that findings that are 
published are more difficult to access, further enclosing the 
intellectual commons. As a result, convivial, open-source com­
petition slides further into something much more like classic 
market competition. 
There are all sorts of forms of privatizat ion, up to and includ­
ing the simple buying-up and suppression of inconvenient 
discoveries by large corporations for fear of their economic 
136 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
effects. 108 All this is much noted. More subtle is the way the 
managerial ethos itself militates against the implementation of 
anything remotely adventurous or quirky, especially; if there is 
no prospect of immediate results. Oddly, the Internet can be 
part of the problem here: 
Most people who work in corporations or academia 
have witnessed something like the following: A 
numb er of engineers are sitting together in a room, 
bouncing ideas off each other. Out of the discussion 
emerges a new concept that seems promising. Then 
some laptop-wielding person in the corner, having 
perf ormed a quick Google search, announces that this 
"new" idea is, in fact, an old one; it-or at least vaguely 
similar-has already been tried. Either it failed, or it 
succeeded. If it failed, then no manager who wants 
to keep his or her job will approve spending money 
trying to revive it. If it succeeded, then it's patented 
and entry to the market is presumed to be unattain­
able, since the first people who thought of it will have 
"first-mover advantage" and will have created "barriers 
to entry ." The numb er of seemingly promising ideas 
that have been crushed in this way must number in 
the millions. 109 
I could go on, but I assume the reader is getting the idea. 
A timid, bureaucratic spirit has come to suff use every aspect 
of intellectual life. More often than not, it comes cloaked in 
a· language of creativity, init iative, and entrepreneurialism. But 
the language is meaningless. The sort of thinkers most likely to 
come up with new conceptual breakthroughs are the least likely 
to receive funding, and if, some how, breakthroughs nonetheless 
occur, they will almost cert ainly never find anyone willing to 
follow up on the most daring impl ications. 
137 The Utopia of Rules 
Let me return in more detail to some of the historical context 
briefly outlined in 'the intro dµction. 
Giovanni Arrighi, the Italian political economist, has 
observed that after the South Sea Bubble, British capitalism 
largely abandoned the corporate form. The combination of 
high finance and small family firms that had emerged after the 
industrial revolution continued to hold thro ughout the next 
centur y-Marx's London, a period of maximum scientific 
and technological innovation; or Manchester; or Birming­
ham were not dominated by large conglomerates but mainly 
by capitalists who owned a single factory. (This is one reason 
Marx could assume capitalism was characterized by constant 
cutthroat competition.) Britain at that time was also notori­
ous for being just as generous to its oddballs and eccentrics 
as contemporary America is. intolerant. One common expedi­
ent was to allow them to become rural vicars, who, predict­
ably, became one of the main sources for amateur scientific 
discove ries.110 
As I mentioned, contempora ry, bureaucratic, corporate 
capitalism first arose in the United States and Ger many. The 
two bloody wars these rivals fought culminated, appropriately 
enough, in vast gove rnment-sponsored scientific programs 
to see who would be the first to discover the atom bomb. 
Indeed, even the structure of U.S. universities has always been 
based on the Prussian model. True, during these early years, 
both the United States and Germany did manage to find a 
way to cultivate their creative ecce ntrics-in fact, a surprising 
number of the most notorious ones that ended up in America 
(Albert Einstein was the paradigm) actually were German. 
During the war, when matters were desperate, vast govern­
ment projects like the Manhattan Project were still capable of 
accommodating a whole host of bizarre characters (Oppen­
heimer, Feynman, Fuchs ... ). But as American power grew 
138 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
more and more secure, the country's bureaucracy became less 
and less tolerant of its outliers. And technological creativity 
declined. 
The current age of stagnation seems to have begun after 1945, 
precisely at the moment the United States finally and defini­
tively replac ed the UK as organizer of the world econom y.111 
True, in the early days of the U.S. Space Program- another 
period of panic-there was still room for genuine oddballs like 
Jack Parsons, the founder of NASA's Jet Propulsion Labora­
tory . Parsons was not only a brilliant engineer-he was also a 
Thelemite magician in the Aleister Crowley tradition, known 
for regularly orchestrating ceremonial orgies in his California 
home. Parsons believed that rocket science was ultimately just 
one manif estation of deeper, magical principles. But he was 
eventually fired. 112 U.S. victory in the Cold War guaranteed 
a corporatization of existing university and scientific bu­
reaucracies sufficiently thorough to ensure that no one like 
him would ever get anywhere near a position of authority to 
start with. 
Americans do not like to think of themselves as a nation of 
bureaucrats-quite the opposite, really -but, the moment we 
stop imagining bureaucracy as a phenomenon limited to gov­
ernment offices, it becomes obvious that this is precisely what 
we have become. The final victory over the Soviet Union did 
not really lead to the domination of "the mark et:' More than 
anything, it simply cemented the dominance of fundamentally 
cons ervative managerial elites-corporate bureaucrats who use 
the pretext of short-term, competitive, bottom-line thinking to 
squelch anything likely to have revolutionary implications of 
any kind. 
139 The Utopia of Rules 
Syn thesis 
On the Movement from Poetic to Bureaucratic Technol ogies 
"All the labor-s aving machinery that has hitherto been in­
vented has not lessened the toil of a single human being:' 
-John Stuart Mill 
It is the premise of this book that we live in a deeply bureau­
cratic society . If we do not notice it, it is largely because bureau­
cratic practices and requirements have become so all-pe rvasive 
that we can barely see them-or worse, cannot imagine doing 
things any other way. 
Computers have played a crucial role in all of this. Just as 
the invention of new forms of industrial automation in the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries had the paradoxical effect 
of turning more and more of the world's population into full­
time industrial workers, so has all the software desig ned to 
save us from administrative responsibilities in recent decades 
ultimately turned us all into part or full-time administrato rs. 
Just as university professors seem to feel it is inevitable that they 
will spend more and more of their time managing grants, so 
do parents simply accept that they will have to spend weeks of 
every year filling out forty-page online forms to get their chil­
dren into acceptable schools, and store clerks realize that they 
will be spending increasing slices of their waking lives punch­
ing passwords into their phones to access, and manage, their 
various bank and credit accounts, and pretty much everyone 
understands that they have to learn how to perform jobs once 
relegated to travel agents, brokers, and accountants . 
Someone once figured out that the average American will 
spend a cumulative six months of her life waiting for the light 
to change. I don't know if similar figures are available for how 
long she is likely to spend filling out forms , but it must be at 
least that much. If nothing else, I think it's safe to say that no 
140 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
population in the history of the world has spent nearly so much 
time engaged in paperwork. 
Yet all of this is supposed to have happened after the over­
throw of horrific, old-f ashioned, bureaucratic socialism, and 
the triumph of freedom and the market. Certainly this is one of 
the great paradoxes of contemporary life, much though-like the 
broken promises of techn ology-we seem to have deve loped a 
profound reluctance to address the problem. 
Clea rly, these problems are linked-I would say, in many 
ways, they are ultimately the same problem. Nor is it merely a 
matter of bureaucratic, or more specifically managerial, sensi­
bilities having choked off all forms of technical vision and cre­
ativity. After all, as we're constantly reminded, the Internet has 
unleashed all sorts of creative vision and collaborative ingenuity. 
What it has really brought about is a kind of bizarre inversion 
of ends and means, where creativity is marshaled to the service 
of administration rather than the other way around. 
I would put it this way: in this final, stultifying stage of capi­
talism, we are moving from poetic technologies to bureaucratic 
technolog ies. 
By poetic technologies, I refer to the use of rational, techni­
cal, bureaucratic means to bring wild, impossible fantasies to 
life. Poetic technologies in this sense are as old as civili zatio n. 
They could even be said to predate complex machine ry. Lewis 
Mumford used to argue that the first complex machines were 
actually made of people. Egyptian pharaohs were only able to 
build the pyramids because of their mastery of administrative 
procedures, which then allowed them to develop production 
line techniques, dividing up complex tasks into dozens of simple 
operations and assiguing each to one team of workmen-even 
though they lacked mechanical technology more complex than 
the lever and inclined plane. Bureaucratic oversight turned 
armies of peasant farmers into the cogs of a vast machine. Even 
much later, after actual cogs had been inve nted, the design of 
141 The Utopia of Rules 
complex machinery was always to some degree an elaboration 
of principles originally devel oped to organize people.113 
Yet still, again and again, we see those machines-whether 
their moving parts are arms and torsos or pistons, wheels, and 
springs- being put to work to realize otherwise impossible 
fantasies: cathedrals, moon shots, transcontinental railways, and 
on and on. Certainl y, poetic technologies almost invariably have 
something terrible about them; the poetry is likely to evoke 
dark satanic mills as much as it does grace or liberation. But the 
rational, bureaucratic techniques are always in service to some 
fantastic end. 
From this perspe ctive, all those mad Soviet plans-even if 
never realized-marked the high-water mark of such poetic 
technologies. What we have now is the reverse. It's not that 
vision, crea tivity, and mad fantasies are no longer encouraged. 
It's that our fantasies remain free-floating; there's no longer even 
the pretense that they could ever take form or flesh. Meanwhile, 
in the few areas in which free, imaginative creativity actually 
is fostered, such as in open-source Internet software deve lop­
ment, it is ultimately marshaled in order to create even more, 
and even more eff ective, platforms for the filling out of forms. 
This is what I mean by"bureaucratic technologie s": administra­
tive imperatives have become not the means, but the end of 
technological devel opment. Meanwhile, the greatest and most 
powerful nation that has ever existed on this earth has spent 
the last decades telling its citizens that we simply can no lon­
ger contemplate grandiose enterprises, even if--as the current 
environmental crisis suggests-the fate of the earth depends 
on it. 
So what, then, are the political implications? 
First of all, it seems to me that we need to radically rethink 
some of our most basic assumptions about the nature of 
142 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
capitalism. One is that capitalism is somehow identical to the 
mar ket, and that both are therefore inimical to bureaucra cy, 
which is a creature of the state. The second is that capitalism 
is in its nature technologically progressive. It would seem that 
Marx and Engels, in their giddy enthusiasm for the industrial 
revolutions of their day, were simply wrong about this. Or to be 
more precise: they were right to insist that the mechanization of 
industrial production would eventually destroy capitalism; they 
were wrong to predict that market competition would compel 
factory owners to-go on with mechanization anyway. !fit didn't 
happen, it can only be because market competition is not, in 
fact, as essential to the nature of capitalism as they had assumed. 
If nothing else, the current form of capitalism, where much of 
the competition seems to take the form of internal marketing 
within the bureaucratic structures of large semi-monopolistic 
enterprises, would presumably have come as a complete sur­
oprise to them. 114 
Def enders of capitalism generally make three broad historical 
claims: first, that it has fostered rapid scientific and technological 
deve lopment; second, that however much it may throw enor-
. mous wealth to a small minority , it does so in such a way that 
increases overall prosperity for everyone; third, that in doing so, 
it creates a more secure and democratic world. It is quite clear 
that in the twenty-first century, capitalism is not doing any of 
these things. In fact, even its proponents are increasingly retreat­
ing from any claim that it is a particular good system, falling 
back instead on the claim that it is the only possible system-or 
at least, the only possible system for a complex, technologically 
sophisticated society such as our own. 
As an anthropologist, I find myself dealing with this latter 
argument all the time. 
SKEPT1c :You can dream your utopian dreams all you like, 
I'm talking about a political or economic system that 
143 The Utopia of Rules 
could actually work. And exp erience has shown us that 
what we have is really the only option here. 
ME: Our particular current form of limited representa­
tive gove rnment-or corporate capitalism-is the only 
possible political or economic system? Experience shows 
us no such thing. If you look at human history, you 
can find hundr eds, even thousands of diff erent political 
and economic systems . Many of them look absolutely 
nothing like what we have now. 
SKEPTIC: Sure, but you're talking about simpler, 
small-scale societies, or ones with a much simpler 
technological base. I'm talking about modern, complex, 
technologically advan ced societies. So your counter­
examples are irrelevant. 
ME: Wait, so you're saying that technological progress has 
actually limited our social possi bilities? I thought it was 
supposed to be the other way around! 
But even if you concede the point, and agree that for what­
ever reason, while a wide variety of economic systems might 
once have been equally viable, modern industrial technology 
has created a world in which this is no longer the case-could 
anyone seriously argue that current economic arrangements are 
also the only ones that will ever be viable under any possible 
future technological regime as well? Such a statement is self­
evidently absurd. If nothing else, how could we possibly know? 
Grante d, there are people who take that position-on both 
ends of the political spectrum. As an anthr opologist and anar­
chist, I have to deal fairly regularly with "anticiv ilizational" types 
who insist not only that current industrial technology can only 
lead to capitalist-style oppression, but that this must necessarily 
144 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
be true of any future technology as well: and therefore, that 
human liberation can only be achieved by a return to the Stone 
Age. Most of us are not such technological determinists. But 
ultimately, claims for the present-day inevitability of capitalism 
have to be based on some kind of technological determ in­
ism. And for that very reason, if the ultimate aim of neoliberal 
capitalism is to create a world where no one believes any other 
economic system could really work, then it needs to suppress 
not just any idea of an inevitable redemptive future, but really 
any radically different technological future at all. There's a kind 
of contradiction here. It cannot mean convincing us that tech­
nological change has come to an end-since that would mean 
capitalism is not really progressive. It means convincing us that 
technological progress is indeed continuing, that we do live in 
a world of wonders, but to ensure those wonders largely take 
the form of modest improvements (the latest iPhone!), rumors 
of inventions about to happen ("I hear they actually are going 
to have flying cars pretty soon"), 115 even more complex ways 
of juggling information and imagery , and even more complex 
platforms for the filling out of forms. 
I do not mean to suggest that neoliberal capitalism-or any 
other system-could ever be permanently success ful in this 
regard. First, there's the problem of trying to convince the world 
you are leading the way in terms of technological progress when 
you are actually holding it back.With its decaying infr astructure 
and paralysis in the face of global warming, the United States 
is doing a particularly bad job of this at the moment. (This 
is not to mention its symbolically devastating abandonment 
of the manned space program, just as China revs up its own.) 
Second, there's the fact that pace of change simply can't be 
held back forever.At best it can be slowed down. Breakthroughs 
will happen; inconvenient discoveries cannot be permanently 
suppressed. Other, less bureaucratized parts of the world-or at 
least, parts of the world with bureaucracies that are not quite so 
145 The Utopia of Rules 
hostile to creative thinking-wi ll, slowly, inevitably, attain the 
resources required to pick up where the United States and its 
allies have left off. The Internet does provide opportunities for 
collaboration and dissemination that may eventually help break 
us through the wall, as well.Where will the breakthrough come? 
We can't know. Over the last couple years, since the first version 
of this essay saw print, there has been a whole spate of new 
possibilities: 3-D printing, advances in materials technologies, 
self-driving cars, a new generation of robots, and as a result, a 
new spate of discussi on of robot factories and the end of work. 
There are hints, too, of impending conceptual breakthroughs in 
physics, biol ogy, and other sciences, made all the more difficult 
because of the absolute institutional lock of existing orthodox­
ies, but which might well have profound technological implica­
tions as well. 
At this point, the one thing I think we can be fairly con­
fident about it is that invention and true innovation will not 
happen within the framework of contemporary cor por ate 
capitalism-or, most likely, any form of capitalism at all. It's 
becoming increasingly clear that in order to really start setting 
up domes on Mars, let alone develop the means to figure out 
if there actually are alien civilizations out there to contact-or 
what would actually happen if we shot something through a 
wormhol e-- we're going to have to figure out a different eco­
nomic system entirely. Does it really have to take the form of 
some massive new bureaucracy? Why do we assume it must? 
Perhaps it's only by breaking up existing bureaucratic structures 
that we'll ever be able to get ther e.And if we're going to actu­
ally come up with robots that will do our laundry or tidy up 
the kitchen, we're going to have to make sure that whatever 
replaces capitalism is based on a far more egalitarian distribu­
tion of wealth and power-one that no longer contains either 
the super-rich or desperately poor people willing to do their 
housework. Only then will technology begin to be marshaled 
146 Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit 
toward human needs. And this is the best reason to break free of 
the dead hand of the hedge fund managers and the CEOs-to 
free our fantasies from the screens in which such men have 
imprisoned them, to let our imaginations once again become a 
material force in human history.

The Uto pia of Rules, 
or Why We Reall y Love 
Bureaucrac y After All 
Everyone complains about bureau cracy. The essays in this book 
have themselves largely consisted of such complaints. Nobody · 
seems to likes bureaucracy very much-yet somehow, we always 
seem to end up with more of it. 
In this essay I'd like to ask why that is, and particul arly, to 
consider the possibility that many of the blanket condemnations 
of bureaucracy we hear are in fact somewhat disingenu ous. 
That the experience of operating within a system of formalized 
rules and regula tions, under hierarchies of impersonal officials, 
actually does hold-' for many of us much of the time, for all of 
us at least some of the time-a kind of covert appeal. 
Now, I am aware this is not the only possible expla nation.There 
is a whole school of thought that holds that bureaucracy tends 
to expand accor ding to a kind of perverse but inescapable inner 
logic. The argument runs as follows: if you create a bureaucratic 
149 The Utopia of Rules 
structure to deal with some problem, that structure will invari­
ably -end up creating other problems that seem as if they, too, 
can only be solved by bureaucratic means. In univers ities, this 
is sometimes informally referred to as the " creating committees 
to deal with the problem of too many committ ees" problem. 
A slightly different version of the argument-this is really 
the core of Max Weber' s reflections on the subject -is that a 
bureaucracy, once created, will immediately move to make itself 
indispensable to anyo ne trying to wield power, no matter what 
they wish to do with it. The chief way to do this is always by 
attempting to monopolize access to certain key types of infor­
mation. We ber is worth quoting at length on this subject: 
150 Every bureaucracy seeks to increase the superiority of 
the prof essionally informed by keeping their knowl­
edge and intentions secret. Bureaucratic administration 
always tends to be an administration of" secret sessions": 
in so far as it can, it hides its knowledge and action from 
criticism ... 
The concept of the "official secret" is the specific 
inve ntion of bureaucracy, and nothing is so fanatically 
def ended by the bureaucracy as this attitude, which can­
not be substantially justified beyond these specifical ly 
qualified areas. In facing a parliament, the bureaucracy, 
out of a sure power instin ct, fights every attempt of 
the parliament to gain knowledge by means of its own 
experts or from interest groups ... 
The absolute monarch is powerless opposite the 
superior knowledge of the bureaucratic expert-in a 
certain sense more powerless than any other political 
head. All the scornful decrees of Frederick the Great 
concerning the "abolition of serf dom" were derailed, 
as it were, in the course of their realization because 
the official mechanism simply ignore d them as the The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
occasional ideas of a dilettante. When a constitutional 
king agrees with a socially important part of the gov­
erned, he very frequently exerts a greater influence upon 
the course of administration than does the "absolute 
monarch." The constitutional king can control these 
experts- better because of what is, at least relatively, 
the public character of criticism, whereas the absolute 
monarch is dependent for information solely upon the 
bureaucrac y. The Russian czar of the old regime was 
seldom able to accomplish permanently anything that 
displeased his bureaucracy and hurt the power interests 
of the bureaucra ts.'" 
One side effect, as We ber also observes, is that once you do 
create a bureaucracy, it's almost impossible to get rid of it. The 
very first bureaucracies we know of were in Mesopotamia and 
Egypt, and these continued to exist, largely unchanged, as one 
dynasty or ruling elite replaced another, for literally thousands 
of years. Similarly, waves of successful invaders were not enough 
to dislodge the Chinese civil service, with its bureaus, reports, 
and examination system, which remained firmly in place no 
matter who actually claimed the Mandate of Heaven. In fact, 
as We ber also noted, foreign invaders needed the skills and 
knowledge so jealously guarded by Chinese bureaucrats even 
more than indigenous rulers did, for obvious reasons. The only 
real way to rid 9neself of an established bureaucracy, accor ding 
to Web er, is to simply kill them all, as Alaric the Goth did in 
Imperial Rome, or Genghis Khan in certain parts of the Middle 
East. Leave any significant number of functionaries alive, and 
within a few years, they will inevitably end up managing one's 
kingdom. 
The second possible explanation is that bureaucracy does 
not just make itself indispensable to rulers, but holds a genuine 
appeal to those it administers as well. One need not agree here 
151 The Utopia of Rules 
with We ber's curious celebration of bureaucratic efficiency. The 
simplest explanation for the appeal of bureaucratic procedures 
lies in their impersonality. Cold, impersonal, bureaucratic rela­
tions are much like cash transactions, and both offer similar 
advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand they are soulless. 
On the other, they are simple, predictable, and- within certain 
parameters, at least-treat everyone more or less the same. And 
anyway, who really wants to live in a world where everything 
is soul? Bureaucracy holds out at least the possibility of dealing 
with other human beings in ways that do not demand either 
party has to engage in all those complex and exhausting forms 
of interpretive labor describ ed in the first essay in this book, 
where just as you can simply place your money on the counter 
and not have to worry about what the cashier thinks of how 
you're dressed, you can also pull out your validated photo ID 
card without having to explain to the librarian why you are so 
keen to read about homoerotic themes in eighteenth century 
British verse. Surely this is part of the appeal. In fact, if one 
really ponders the matter, it's hard to imagine how, even if we 
do achieve some utopian communal society , some impersonal 
(dare I say, bureaucratic?) institutions would not still be nec­
essary, and for just this reason. To take one obvious exam ple: 
languishing on some impersonal lottery system or waiting list 
for a desperately needed organ transplant might be alienating 
and distressing, but it's difficult to envis ion any less impe rs,onal 
way of allocating a limi ted pool of hearts or kidneys that would 
not be immeasurably worse. 
This is, as I say, the simplest explanation. But in this essay I'd 
like to explore the possibility that all this goes much deeper. It's 
not just that the impersonal relations bureaucracies afford are 
conveni ent; to some degree, at least, our very ideas of rational­
ity, justice, and above all, freedom, are founded on them. To 
explain why I believe this to be the case, let me begin, first of 
all, by examining two moments in human history when new 
152 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
bureaucratic forms actually did inspire not just widespread pas­
sive acquiescence but giddy enthusiasm, even infatuation, and 
try to understand precisely what it was about them that seemed, 
to so many people, so exciting. 
I. The Enchantment of Disenchantment, or The Magical 
Powers of the Post Office 
One reason it was possible for Weber to describe bureaucracy 
as the very embodiment of rational efficiency is that in the 
Germany of his day, bureaucratic institutions really did work 
well. Perhaps the flagship institution, the pride and joy of the 
German civil service was the Post Office. In the late nineteenth 
century, the German postal service was considered one of the 
great wonders of the modern world. Its efficiency was so leg­
endary, in fact, that it casts a kind of terrible shadow across the 
twentieth centu ry, Many of the greatest achievements of what 
we now call "high modernism" were inspired by-or in many 
cases, built in direct imitation of-the German Post Office.And 
one could indeed make a case that many of the most terrible 
woes of that century can also be laid at its feet. 
To understand how this could be, we need to understand a 
little of the real origins of the modern social welfare state, which 
we now largely think of-when we think of them at all-as 
having been created by benevolent democratic elites. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. In Europe, most of the key 
institutions of what later became the welfare state-everything 
from social insurance and pensions to public libraries and public 
health clini cs-were not originally created by gov ernments at 
all, but by trade unions, neighborhood associations, coopera­
tive s, and working-class parties and organizations of one sort 
or another. Many of these were engaged in a self-conscious 
revolu tionary project "of"bu ilding a new society in the shell of 
the old;' of gradually creating Socialist institutions from below. 
153 The Utopia of Rules 
For some it was combined with the aim of eventually seizing 
control of the gove rnment through parliamentary means, for 
others, it was a project in itself. One must remember that dur­
ing the late nineteenth cent ury, even the direct heirs of Marx's 
Communist Party had largely abandoned the idea of seizing 
control of the government by force, since this no longer seemed 
necessary; in a Europe at peace and witnessing rapid techno­
logical progress, they felt that it should be possible to create a 
social revolution through peaceful, electoral means. 
Germany was one of the places where such parties were 
most successful. Even though Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, 
the great mastermind behind the creation of the German 
state, allowed his parliament only limited powers, he was con­
founded by the rapid rise of workers' parties, and continually 
worried by the prospect of a Socialist majority, or a possible 
Paris Commune-style uprising in his new united German y. His 
reaction to Socialist electoral success from 1878 was twofold: on· 
the one hand, to ban the Socialist party, trade unions, and leftist 
newsp apers; on the other, when this proved ineffective (Social­
ist candidates continued to run, and win, as independents) , 
to create a top-down alternative to the free schools, work ers' 
associations, friendly societies, libraries, theaters, and the larger 
process of building socialism from below. This took the form of 
a program of social insurance (for unemployment, health and 
disability, etc.), free education, pensions, and so forth-much 
of it watered-down versions of policies that had been part of 
the Socialist platform, but in every case, carefully purged of 
any democratic, participatory elements. In private, at least, he 
was utterly candid about describing these eff orts as a "bribe," 
an effort to buy out working-class loyalties to his conserva­
tive na\i,onalist project.'" When left-wing regimes did later take 
power, the template had already been established, and almost 
invariably, they took the same top-down approach, incorporat­
ing locally organized clinics, libraries, mutual banking initiativ es, 
154 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
workers' education centers, and the like into the administrative 
structure of the state. 
In German y, the real model for this new administrative 
structure was, curiou sly, the post office-though when one 
understands the history of the postal servi ce, it makes a great 
deal of sense. The post office was, essentially, one of the first 
attempts to apply top-down, military forms of organization to 
the public good. Historica lly, postal services first emerged from 
the organization of armies and empires. They were originally 
ways of conveying field reports and orders over long distances; 
later, by extension, a key means of keeping the resulting empires 
together. Hence Herodotus' famous quote about Persian impe­
rial messengers, with their evenly spaced posts with fresh 
horses, which he claimed allowed the swiftest travel on earth: 
"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays 
these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed 
rounds" still appears carved over the entrance to the Central 
Post Office building in New York, opposite Penn Statio n.118 The 
Roman Empire had a similar system, and pretty much all armies 
operated with postal courier systems until Napoleon adopted 
semaphore in 1805. 
One of the great innovations of eighteenth- and especially 
nineteenth-century governance was to expand what had once 
been military courier systems into the basis for an emerging 
civil service whose primary purpose was providing services for 
the public. It happened first in commerce, and then expanded 
as the commercial classes also began to use the post for personal 
or political correspondence -until finally it was being used by 
just about every one.'" Before long, in many of the emerging 
nation-states in Europe and the Americas , half the govermnent 
budget was spent on-and more than half the civil service 
employed in-the postal servi ce.120 
In Germ any, one could even make the argument that the 
nation was created, more than anything else, by the post office. 
155 The Utopia of Rules 
Under the Holy Roman Empire, the right to run a postal 
courier system within imperial territories had been granted, in 
good feudal fashion, to a noble family originally from Milan, 
later to be known as the Barons von Thurn and Taxis (one later 
scion of this family, according to legend, was the inve ntor of the 
taximeter, which is why taxicabs ultimately came to bear his 
name) . The Prussian Empire originally bought out the Thurn 
and Taxis monopoly in 1867, and used it as the basis for a new 
German national post-and over the next two decades, the sure 
sign that a new statelet or principality had been absorbed into 
the emerging nation-state was its incorporation into the Ger­
man postal system. Partly for this reason, the sparkling efficiency 
of the system became a point of national pride. And indeed, 
the German post of the late nineteenth century was nothing if 
not impressive, boasting up to five or even nine delivery times 
a day in major cities, and, in the capital, a vast network of miles 
of pneumatic tubes designed to shoot letters and small parcels 
almost instantly across long distances using a system of pressur­
ized air:

Mark Twain, who lived briefly in Berlin between 1891 
and 1892, was so taken with it that he composed one of his 
only known non-satirical essays, entitle d "Postal Service," 
just to celebrate its wondrous efficiency .'" Nor was he the 
only foreigner to be so impr essed. Just a few months before 
the outbreak of Russian revolution, Vladimir Hych Lenin 
wrote: 
A witty German Social-Democrat of the seventies of 
the last century called the postal service an example of the 
socialist economic system. This is very true. At present 
the postal service is a business organized on the lines 
of a state-ca pitalist monopol y. Imperialism is -gradually 
transforming all trusts into organizations of a similar 
type ... 
To orga nize the whole national economy on the lines 
of the postal service, so that the technicians, foremen, 
bookkeepers, as well as all officials, shall receive salaries 
no higher than "a workman's wage," all under the con­
trol and leadership of the armed proletariat-this is our 
irmnediate aim. 122 
157 The Utopia of Rules 
So there you have it. The organization of the Soviet Union 
was directly modeled on that of the German postal service. 
Neither were state socialists the only ones to be impre ssed. 
Even anarchists joined the chorus; though they were less inter­
ested in the national system than in relations between them­
the fact that it was possible to send a letter from Venezuela to 
China despite the absence of any single overarching state. In 
fact, Peter Kropotkin often cited the international "universal 
postal union" of 1878 (along with accords between railroad 
companies) as a model for 'anarchism-again, emphasizing that 
this was something that was already taking shape at the top of 
imperial systems: 
The Postal Union did not elect an international postal 
parliament in order to make laws for all postal organiza­
tions adherent to the Union ... They proceeded by 
means of agreement. To agree together they resorted 
to congresses; but, while sending delegates to their 
congresses they did not say to them, "Vote about every­
thing you like-we shall obey." They put forward ques­
tions and discussed them first themselves; then they sent 
delegates acquainted with the special question to be 
discussed at the congress, and they sent delegates-n ot 
rulers .123 
This vision of a potential future paradise emerging from 
�ithin the Post Office was not confined to Europe. Indeed, the 
country that was soon to emerge as Germ any's chief rival for 
global influence, the United States, was also held out as a model 
for a new type of civilization, and the efficiency of its own 
Post Service was considered prima Jacie evidence. Already in the 
1830s, Tocqueville had been startled by the size of the postal 
system and the sheer volume of letters being moved about 
even on the frontier. During one journey through Kentucky 
158 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
to Michigan he noted: "There is an astonishing circulation of 
letters and newspap ers among these savage woods;' far more, 
he calculated, than in even the most populous and commercial 
provinces of France. In the words of one later historian of the 
American Republic : 
Americans would soon make their postal system larger 
than the postal systems of either Britain or France. By . 
1816 the postal system had over thirty-three hundred 
offices, employing nearly 70 percent of the entire fed­
eral civilian workforce. The amount of mail increased 
just as quickly. In the year 1790 the postal system had 
carried only three hundred thousand letters, one for 
about every fifteen persons in the count ry. By 1815 it 
transmitted nearly seven and a half million letters dur­
ing the year, which was about one for every person ... 
And, unlike the situation in Great Britain and other 
European nations, the mail was transmi tted without 
government surveillance or control .124 
In fact, for much of the century, from the perspec tive of a 
majority of Americans, the postal service effectively was the 
Federal government. By 1831, its staff already far outnumbered 
that of all other branches of government combined, it was sub­
stantially larger than the army, and for most small-town dwell­
ers, postal employees were the only Federal officials they were 
ever likely to meet. 
In Europe, the United States was at that time itself seen 
as a kind of utopian experiment, with its rejection of laissez­
faire economics, and widespread reliance on cooper atives and 
gove rnment-sponsored projects and tariff protections. It was 
only with the rise of corporate capitalism after the Civil War 
that the United States also adopted something closer to the 
German model of bureaucratic capitalism. When it did, the 
159 The Utopia of Rules 
post office model came to be seen, by Populists and especially 
Progressives, as the major viable alternative. Again, the forms 
of a new, freer, more rational society seemed to be emerging 
within the very structures of oppression itself. In the United 
States, the term used was "postalization" -a unique American 
coinage for nationalization (and one which has, significa ntly, 
since completely disappeared from the language) . Yet at the 
same time as Weber and Lenin were invoking the German 
post office as a model for the future, American Progres­
sives were arguing that even private business would be more 
efficient were it run like the post office, and scoring major 
victories for postalization, such as the nationalization of the 
once-p rivate sub way, commuter, and interstate train systems, 
which in major American cities have remained in public hands 
ever since. 
In retr ospect, all these fantasies of postal utopia seem rather 
quaint, at best. We now associate national postal systems mainly 
with the arrival of things we never wanted in the first place: 
utility bills, overdraf t alerts, mail-order catalogs, solicitations, 
sweep stakes, calls to jury duty, tax audits, one-time-only credit­
card offers, and charity appeals . Insofar as Americans have a 
popular image of postal workers, it has become increasingly 
squalid. But this didn't just happen. It is the result of intentional 
policy choices. Since the 1980s, legislators have led the way 
in systematically defunding the post office and encouraging 
private alternatives as part of an ongoing campaign to convince 
Americans that government doesn't really work .125 As a result, 
the Postal Service quickly became the very definition of every­
thing we were supposed to think was wrong with state bureau­
cracies: there were endless newspaper stories about strikes, 
drug-addled workers, houses full of years' worth of undelivered 
mail, and of course, most famou sly, employees periodically 
"going postal" and opening fire on manag ers, fellow workers, 
and members of the police or general public. In fact the only 
160 The Utopia of Rules, or' Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
reference I could find to the term "postalization" in contem­
porary literature is an essay on workplace violence called "the 
postalization of corporate America;' decrying how an epidemic 
of violent attacks on bosses and co-workers was spreading from 
the public sector into private corporations, too. 
In a fascinating book called Goin g Postal: Rage, Murder, 
and Rebellion from Reagan's T¥orkplaces to Clinto n� Columbine 
and Beyo nd, Mark Ames carefully picked through jour nalistic 
accounts of such events (which did, indeed, quickly spread 
from the Post Office to private offices and factories, and even 
to private postal services like UPS, but in the process, became 
so commonplace that many barely made the national news) 
and noted that the language they employ, which always 
described these events as acts of inexplicable individual rage 
and madness---.evered from any consideration of the system­
atic humiliations that always seem to set them off-bears an 
uncanny resemblance to the way the nine_ teenth-century press 
treated slave revolts. 126 Ames notes that there were remarkably 
few organized slave rebellions in American history. But there 
were a fair number of incidents in which individual slaves, or 
small groups, struck out in a similar fashion against overseers, 
masters, and their families with axes, knives, poison, or whatever 
means of immediate violence were at hand. In both cases, jour­
nalists treated such outbreaks as the result of either individual 
insanity, or inexplicable malice. In fact, to even suggest possible 
structural explanations-to speak of the evils of slavery, or to 
point out that before the eighties reforms in corporate culture 
that destroyed earlier assurances of secure lifetime employment 
and protections for workers against arbitrary and humiliating 
treatment by superiors, there had not been a single workplace 
massacre in all American history (other than by slaves)---.eemed 
somehow immoral, since it would imply such violence was in 
some way justified. 
It can't be denied, too, there was a major racial component 
161 The Utopia of Rules 
in the rhetoric. Just as for much of the twentieth century the 
post office stood, in the eyes ofworking-clas sAfr ican-American 
communities, as the very paradigm of stable, secure, but also 
respectable and community service-oriented employment, 127 so 
after Reagan it came to be pictured as embodyin � all the sup­
posed degradatio n, violence, drug abuse, and inefficiency of a 
welfare state that was viewed in deeply racist terms. (This iden­
tification of African-Americans both with the stuffy bureaucrat, 
and with scary random violence, appears again and again in 
U.S. popular culture-though rarely, it's true, both at the same 
time. It is a strange, repetitive feature of action movies that the 
infuriating go-by-the-rules boss of the maverick hero is almost 
invariably Blac k.)128 
Yet at the very same time that symb olic war was being waged on 
the Postal Service-as it was descending in the popular imagina­
tion into a place of madness, degradation, and violence-some­
thing remarkably similar to the turn-of -the-century infatuation 
with the Postal Service was happening again. Let us summarize 
the story so far: 
162 1. A new communicat ions technology develops out 
of the military. 
2. It spreads rapidly, radically reshaping everyday life. 
3. It develops a reputation for dazzling efficiency. 
4. Since it operates on non-market principles, it is 
quickly seized on by radicals as the first stirrings of 
a future, non-capitalist economic system already 
developing within the shell of the old. 
5. Despite this, it quickly becomes the medium, 
too, for government surveillance and the 
dissemination of endless new forms of advertising and 
unwanted paperwork. The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
Put it in these terms, it should be obvious enough what I'm 
referring to.This is pretty much exactly the story of the Internet. 
What is email, after all, but a giant, glob e-spanning, electronic, 
super-efficient Post Office? Has it not, too, created a sense 
of a new, remarkably effective form of coope rative economy 
emerging from within the shell of capitalism itself -even as it 
has deluged us with scams, spam, and commercial offers, and 
allowed the government to spy on us in new and creative ways? 
Obviou sly, there are differences. Most obviou sly, the Inter­
net involves a much more participatory, bottom-up form of 
cooperation. This is important. But for the moment, I am less 
interested in the larger historical significance of the phenom­
enon than I am in asking: what does this tell us about the appeal 
of bureaucracy itself? 
We ll, first of all, it seems significant that while both postal 
services and the Internet emerge from the military, they could 
be seen as adopting military technologies to quintessential anti­
military purposes. Organized violence, as I've argued, insofar as 
it is a form of communication, is one that radically strips down, 
simplifi es, and ultimately prevents communication; insofar as 
it as a form of action, it is really a form of anti- action, because 
its ultimate purpose is to prevent others from being able to 
act (either to act in certain ways, or, if one kills them, to ever 
act in any way ever again.) Yet here we have a way of taking 
those very stripped-down, minimalistic forms of action and 
communication typical of military systems-whether chains of 
command or binary codes --ml d turning them into the invis­
ible base on which everything they are not can be constructed: 
drea ms, projects, declarations oflove and passion, artistic effu­
sions, subversive manif estos, or pretty much anything else. They 
allow for the creation and maintenance of social relations that 
could never have existed otherwise. But all this also implies that 
bureaucracy appeals to us-that it seems at its most liberat­
ing-p recisely when it disappears : when it becomes so rational 
163 The Utopia of Rules 
and reliable that we are able to just take it for granted that we 
can go to sleep on a bed of numbers and wake up with all those 
numbers still snugly in place. 
In this sense, bureaucracy enchants when it can be seen 
as a species of what I've called poetic technol ogy, that is, one 
where mechanical forms of organi zation, usually military in 
their ultimate inspiration, can be marshaled to the realization 
of impossible visions: to create cities out of nothing, scale the 
heavens, make the desert bloom. For most of human history 
this kind of power was only available to the rulers of empires 
or commanders of conquering armies, so we might even speak 
here of a democratization of despotism. Once, the privileged 
of waving one's hand and having a vast invisible army of cogs 
and wheels organize themselves in such a way as to bring your 
whims into being was avai lable only to the very most privileged 
few; in the modern world, it can be subdivided into millions 
of tiny portions and made available to everyone able to write a 
letter, or to flick a switch.'" 
All this implies a certain very peculiar notion of freedom. 
Even more, I think, it marks a reversal of earlier ways of think­
ing about rationality whose significance could hardly be more 
profound. 
Let me explain what I mean by this. 
We stern intellectual traditions have always tended to assume 
that humans' powers of reason exist, first and foremost, as ways 
of restraining our baser insti ncts. The assumption can already 
be found in Plato and Aristotle, and it was strongly reinf orced 
when classical theories of the soul were adopted into Christian­
ity and Islam. Yes, the argument went, we all have animalistic 
drives and passions, just as we have our powers of creativity 
and imagination, but these impulses are ,ultimately chaotic and 
antisocial. Reason-whether in the individual or the politi­
cal community-exists to keep our lower nature in check, to 
repress, channel, and contain potentially violent energies in 
164 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
such a way that they -do not lead to chaos and mutual destruc­
tion. It is a moral force. This is why, for instance, the word polis, 
the political community and place of rational order, is the same 
root that gives us both "politeness" and "police:' As a result, too, 
there is always a lurking sense in this tradition that there must 
be something at least vaguely demonic about our powers of 
creat ivity . 
The emergence of bureaucratic populism, as I've been 
describing it, corresponds to a complete reversal of this concep­
tion of rationality-to a new ideal, one most famously summed 
up by David Hume: that "reason is and ought only to be the 
slave of the passions." '30 Rationality, in this view, has nothing 
to do with morali ty. It is a purely technical affair-an instru­
ment, a machine, a means of calculating how to most efficie ntly 
achieve goals that could not themselves be in any way assessed 
in rational terms. Reason cannot tell us what we should want. 
It can only tell us how best to get it. 
In both versions, reason was somehow outside of creativity, 
desire, or the passions; however, in one, it acted to restrain such 
passions; in the other, to facilitate them. 
The emerging field of economics might have deve loped this 
logic the furthe st, but it is a logic that traces back at least as 
much to bureaucracy as to the marke t. (And one must remem­
ber, most economists are, and always have been, employed by 
large bureaucratic organizations of one sort or another.) The 
whole idea that one can make a strict division between means 
and ends, between facts and valu es, is a product of the bureau­
cratic mind-set, because bureaucracy is the first and only social 
institution that treats the means of doing things as entirely sepa­
rate from what it is that's being done. 131 In this way, bureaucracy 
really has become embedded in the common sense of at least a 
very substantial part of the world's population for quite a long 
period of time. 
But at the same time, it's not as if the older idea of rationality 
165 The Utopia of Rules 
has ever entirely gone away. To the contrary: the two coex­
ist, despite being almost completely contradictory-in con­
stant friction. As a result, our very conception of rationality 
is strangely incoherent. It's entirely unclear what the word is 
supposed to mean. Sometimes it's a means, sometimes it's an 
end. Sometimes it has nothing to do with morali ty, sometimes 
it's the very essence of what's right and good. Sometimes it's a 
method for solving problems; other times, it is itself the solution 
to all possible problems. 
II. Rationalism as a Form of Spirituality 
This bizarre state of affairs is worth reflecting on, because it is 
at the very core of our conception of bureaucrac y. On the one 
hand, we have the notion that bureaucratic systems are simply . 
neutral social technologies. They are just ways of getting from 
A to B, and have no implications whatsoever for the rights and 
wrongs of the matter. I well remember a friend who attended 
the Wo odrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs 
at Princeton, a world-renowned training ground for top-level 
admin istrators, reporting to me with an almost shocked delight 
that he had just been obliged to sign up for a course in "value 
free ethics." On the face of it, this sounds absurd. -But really 
the conce pt follows necessarily from this notion of the role of 
bureaucrats: that they are public servants, and it is the respon­
sibility of servants to do their masters' bidding, no matter what 
that bidding is. Insof ar as their master is something called "the 
public," however, this creates certain prob lems: liow to figure 
out what, exac tly, the public really wants them to do. This was 
what they taught budding functionaries in the "value free eth­
ics" course: how, for example, in the case of planners designing 
a highway system, one might apply quantitative methods to 
determine the relative importance to the public of (a) getting 
to work on time, and (b) not being killed or maimed in a car 
, 
166 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucr acy After All 
accident (in economic jargon, their "revealed pref erences" on 
the matter) , and then set the speed limit accor dingly. 
On the other hand, in complete contradiction with this, there 
remains a modern incarnation of the earlier idea of rationality 
as moral order and therefore as an end in itself. Pretty much 
anyone with a utopian vision, whether Socialist, free market, 
or for that matter religious fundamentalist, dreams of creating a 
social order that will , unlike current arrangements, make some 
sort of coherent sense--and which will, therefore, represent the 
triumph of reason over chaos.132 Needless to say, creating an 
effective bureaucracy always turns out to be the cornerstone of 
any such project. 
Arguments about the role of"r ationality" in politics almost 
invariably play fast and loose with these two contradictory ideas. 
If one tries to go back to basic definitions, things don't get 
much better. In many ways they become considerably worse. 
There is no consensus amongst philosophers about what the 
word "rationality" even means. Accor ding to one tradition, for 
instance, rationality is the application of logic, of pure thought 
untempered by emotions; this pure, object ive thought is then 
seen as the basis of scientific inquiry. This has attained a great 
deal of popular purchase, but there's a fundamental probl em: 
scientific inquiry itself has proved it cannot possibly be true. 
Cognitive psychologists have demonstrated again and again that 
there is no such thing as pure thought divorced from emotions; 
a human being without emotions would not be able to think 
at all.133 
Others pref er a more pragmatic approach, claiming merely 
that a rational argument can be defined as one that is both 
grounded in empirical reali ty, and logically coherent in form. 
The problem here is that these two criteria don't really have 
much to do with one another. One is about observat ion; the 
167 The Utopia of Rules 
'other is about reasoning.134 What do they have in common? 
Main ly, it seems, that when someone makes an argument that 
is either delusional or incoherent, we are equally likely to write 
that person off as not right in the head. On one level, that's fair 
enough: we do call crazy people "irrational." But if so, calling 
someone, or an argument, "rational" is saying almost nothing. 
It's a very weak statement.Y ou're just saying they are not obvi­
ously insane. 
But the moment you turn it around, you realize that claim­
ing one's 'own political positions are based on "rationality" is an 
extremely strong statement. In fact, it's extraordinarily arrogant, 
since it means that those who disagree with those positions are 
not just wrong, but crazy. Similar ly, to say one wishes to create a 
"rational" social order implies that current social arrangements 
might as well have been designed by the inhabitants of a lunatic 
asylum. Now, surely, all of us have felt this way at one time or 
another. But if nothing else, it is an extraordinarily intolerant 
position, since it implies that one's opponents are not just wrong, 
but in a certain sense, wouldn't even know what it would mean 
to be right, unless, by some miracle, they could come around 
and accept the light of reason and &cide to accept your own 
conceptual framework and point of view. 
This tendency to enshrine rationality as a political virtue 
has had the perverse effect of encouraging those repelled by 
such pretentions, or by the people who prof ess them, to claim 
to reject rationality entirely, and embrace "irrationalism." Of 
course, if we simply take rationality in its minimal definition, 
any such position is absurd. You can't really make an argument 
against rationality , because for that argument to be convincing, 
it would itself have to be framed in rational terms. If one is will­
ing to argue with another person at all, one must accept, at least 
on a tacit level, that arguments based in an accurate assessment 
of reality are better than ones that are not (that is, that any argu­
ment that proceeds from the assumption that all buildings are 
168 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
made of green cheese is not worth taking seriously) , and that 
arguments that follow the laws of logic are better than those 
that violate then (i.e., that an argument that since the Mayor of 
Cincinnati is human, all humans are the Mayor of Cincinnati, 
can be similarly dism issed) . 
This is not the place to enter into all the logical traps and 
contradictions that result from this situation. I simply wish to 
ask how we ever got to this point at all. Here I think we have 
no choice but to go back to the very beginning, and look at 
the historical origins of the We stern concept of "rationality" 
in the Greek cities of Southern Italy in the middle of the first 
millennium BC. 
The first philosophical school to represent themselves as 
rationalists, and to treat rationality as a value in itself, were the 
Pythagoreans, who were simultaneously a philosophical and 
scientific school, and a kind of political cult or confraternity 
that managed, at one point or another, to take control of several 
Italian cities.135 Their great intelle ctual discovery was that there 
was a formal similarity between the kind of mathematical ratios 
that could be observed in geom etry, musical intervals, and the 
movements of the planets . The conclusion they reached was 
that the universe was, on some ultimate level at least, composed 
of numbers-a notion now largely remembered for the rather 
charming concept of the inaudible "music of the spheres." The 
cosmos, according to the Pythagoreans, was rational because it 
was ultimately an expression of the principles of number, pitch, 
and vibrat ion, and when the human mind (or soul) exercised 
its powers of reason, it was simply participating in that larger 
rational order, the cosmic "world soul" that animated all.136 
This was the picture of the universe Plato largely adopted in 
Timaeus, and it had enormous influence. By the first and second 
century of the Roman Empire, in fact, variations on the basic 
Pythagorean set of ideas had been adopted by pretty much all 
major philosophical schools-not just the Neoplatonists but the 
169 The Utopia of Rules 
Stoics and even, to some extent, the Epicureans. What' s more, 
it formed the philosophical basis of what Hans Joas originally 
dubbed the emerging " cosmic religion" oflate Antiquity, a fusion 
of elements of Greek cosmological speculation, Babylonian 
astrology, and Egyptian theology, often combined with strains 
of Jewish thought and various traditions of popular mag ic.137 
As Joas noted, this cosmic religion-which assumed that God, 
Reason, and the Cosmos were the same, and the higher fac­
ulties in humans were themselves a form of participation in 
this rational cosmic order-for all its grandeur, represented a 
kind of political retreat. The Pythagoreans , like most Greek 
philo sophers, had been avid participants in the political life of 
the city, which they often sought to reconstitute on rational 
grounds. Under the Roman Empire, this was impossible. All 
political questions were now settled. A single---illl d apparently 
eternal-legal and bureaucratic order regulated public affairs; 
instead of aspiring to change this structure, intellectuals increas­
ingly embraced outright mysticism, aspiring to .find new ways 
to transcend earthly systems entir ely, rising through the various 
planetary spheres, purging themselves of materiality , to the rari­
fied sphere of pure reason, a divine realm of transcendent math­
ematical laws that gov erned time and motion and ultimately 
rendered them illusory . God did not impose these laws, He was 
those laws. Human reason, then, was simply the action of that 
divine principle within us. In this sense, rationality was not just 
a spiritual notion, it was mystical: a technique for achieving 
union with the divi ne. 
This set of assumptions about the nature of ratio nality, 
absorbed into Christianity through Augustine, informs pretty 
much all Medieval philosophy as well, however difficult it was 
to reconcile with the notion of a transcendent willf ul Creator 
(and indeed, much Medieval philosophy was precisely con­
cerned with arguing about different ways of reconciling them) . 
In many ways, all these assumptions are very much still with 
170 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
us. Take the notion, which we all learn as children and most of 
us accept as self-evident truth, that what sets humans apart from 
other animals is rationality (that we, as a species, "possess the fac­
ulty ofreason.") This is very much a Medieval notion.'" If you 
think about it, it also doesn't make a lot of sense. If"rationality" 
is just the ability to assess reality more or less as it is and to draw 
logical conclusions, then most animals are extremely rational. 
They solve problems all the time. Most might not be nearly as 
good at it as humans but there is no fundamental diffe rence in 
kind. There are plenty of other faculties that would make much 
better candidates-ones that actually do seem to be unique to 
humans. One obvious choice would be imagination. Animals 
act in what seem like rational, calculating, goal-directed ways 
all the time, but it's harder to make a case that most of them 
engage in creating self-conscious fantasy worlds ."' Hence the 
anthr opologist Edmund Leach once remarked that what sets 
humans apart from animals is not that they possess an immortal 
soul, but rather, that they are capable of imagining that they 
have one. 140 But of course, if the soul is the seat of Reason, the 
divine element in Man, to say that humans are in possession of 
an immortal soul, and to say that they are rational creatures, is 
to say precisely the same thing. 141 
This conclusion inevitably followed from the logic of the 
Great Chain of Being, where all living creatures were ranked 
in a single hierarchy of increasing rationa lity according to their 
proximity to God, with humans placed at the top of the natural 
order, between animals and angels. 
It's easy to see the grand cosmic hierarchies of late Antiq­
uity, with their archons , planets, and gods, all operating under 
the unfolding of abstract rational laws , as simply images of 
the Roman legal bureaucratic order writ very, very large. The 
curious thing is how this ultimately bureaucratic picture of the 
cosmos was maintained for a thousand years after the Roman 
Empire had collapsed. Medieval and Renaissance theologians 
171 The Utopia of Rules 
produced endless spec ulative tracts about angelic hierarchies 
that if anything represented the universe as more system­
atically bureaucratic than anything ancient philosophers had 
imag ined:142 
So, for instance, in the sixteenth century, Marsilio Ficino 
provided the following summary of the angelic hierarchy, draw­
ing from the work of a fourth century Christian Neoplatonist 
whose real name has long since been forgotten, via the elabora­
tions of Saint Thomas Aquinas and Dante: 
172 Seraphim speculate on the order and provi dence of God. 
Cherubim speculate on the essence and form of God. 
Thrones also speculate, though some descend to works. 
Dominions, like architects, design what the rest execute. 
Virtues execute, and move the heavens, and concur for the 
working of miracles as God's instruments. 
Powers watch that the order of divine gov ernance is not 
interrupted and some of them descend to human things. The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
Principalities care for public affairs, nations, princes, 
magistrat es. 
Archangels direct the divine cult and look after sacred things. 
Angels look after smaller affairs and take charge ofindividuals 
as their guardian angels. 143 
Angels are" celestial intelligences" ranked in order from those 
who engage in pure thought to those who concern themselves 
with the actual governance of worldly affairs. At a time when 
actual governance in Europe was as broken and fragmented as 
it could possibly be, its intellectuals were busying themselves 
arguing about the exact division of powers within a single, 
grand, unified, imaginary system of cosmic administration. 
Nowadays, the grand synthesis of late Antiqui ty, revived by 
Renaissance alchemists and mages like Ficino, Agrippa, and 
Giordano Bruno (and in the process infused with Cabala, 
and other spiritual trad ition s), survives largely as the basis of 
We stern ceremonial magic. The Enlighteruuent is supposed to 
have marked a fundamental break with it. But the fundamental 
structure of assumptions did not really change. The appeal to 
rationality in Descartes and his successors remains a funda­
mentally spiritual, even mystical, commitment, that the math­
ematical or math-like abstractions that are assumed to be the 
essence of thought, are also the ordering principles that regulate 
nature-and this remained true whether they were identified 
. with God, or seen as the ultimate proof of God's nonexistence. 
It is hard to think this way because of course we have by 
now come to identify the soul not with reason, but with every­
thing that makes us unique, idiosyncratic, or imaginative. But 
this view is a product of the Romantic era, and one that, at 
the time, marked a near total break from earlier conceptions. 
Again, this is hardly the place to go into detail concerning the 
173 The Utopia of Rules 
arguments about the relation between reason, imagination , 
and desire that came out of it, but it does help us understand 
why it is that the notion of "rationali ty," and particul arly, of 
bureaucratic rationalit y, never seems to be able to contain itself 
to simple questions of deduc tive reasoning, or even technical 
efficie ncy, but almost invariably ends up trying to turn itself 
into some gran diose cosmological scheme. 
Ill. On the Bureaucratiza tion of the Antibur eaucratic Fantasy 
"The point when I decided I just didn't care about that 
[academic] job any more was when I stopped turning off 
the sound on my computer games during office hours. 
There'd be some student waiting outside for feedback on 
his assignment and I was like, 'Wait, just let me finish kill­
ing this dwarf and I'll get back to you:" 
-academic friend (name withheld for obvious reasons) 
The fact that modern science is to some degree founded on 
spiritual commitments , of course, in no way implies that its 
findings are not true. But I think it does suggest that we might 
do well to step back and think very carefully the moment 
whenever someone claims to be trying to create a more ratio­
nal social order (espe cially, when they could have just as easily 
described that social order as reasonable, more decent, less vio­
lent, or more just.) 
We have seen how the European Middle Ages produced the 
vision of a virtual celestial bureau cracy, based distantly on that of 
ancient Rome, 144 which was seen as the embodiment of cosmic 
rationality, in a time when real bureaucracy was particularly thin 
on the ground. Over time, of course, it grew considerably less 
so. But as new bureaucratic states did emerge, and particularly 
174 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
as bureaucratic rationality became the predominant principle 
of govern ance in eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe 
and America, we witness a kind of countermovement: the rise 
of an equally fantastic vision of the Middle Ages, full of princes, 
knights, faeries, drago ns, sorcerers, and unicorns; and eventually, 
hobbits , dwarv es, and ores. In most important ways, this world 
is explicitly antibure aucrat ic: that is, it evinces an explicit rejec­
tion of virtually all the core values of bureaucracy. 
In the last essay, I observed that science fiction has come to as­
semble a fairly standardized list of future inve ntions-from tele­
portation to warp drive-and to deploy them so regularly-n ot 
just in literature but in games, TV shows, comics, and similar 
material--1mch that pretty much any teenager in Canada, Nor­
way, or Japan can be exp ected to know what they are. The same 
could be said of the basic constituents of this fantasy literature, 
which, though obviously varying from text to text, movie to 
movie, nonetheless center on a remarkably consistent basic set 
of character types, systems of government (mostly magical) , 
technologies, beasts, and cultural tradit ions. Needless to say it 
bears almost no resemblance, on any level, to what the Middle 
Ages were really like. But to understand the real historical ori­
gins of this world requires going much further back in time. 
We are used to speaking of "the state" as a single entity but 
actual ly, I think, modern states are better seen as the confluence 
of three different elements , whose historical origins are quite 
distinct, have no intrinsic relation with one another, and may 
already be in the process of finally drif ting apart. 
I will call these sovereignty, administration, and politics. 
Sovereignty is usually taken to be the defining feature of the 
state: a sovereign state is one whose ruler claims a monopoly 
over the legitimate use of violence within a given territo ry. 
Most governments in the ancient world, or for that matter 
175 The Utopia of Rules 
the Middle Ages, never claimed sovereignty in this sense. Nor 
would it have occurred to them to do so: this was the logic of 
conquering empire s, not of any sort of civil ized community . 
The second principle is administration, which can and of ten 
does exist without any single center of power to enforce its de­
cisions. It could also, of course, simply be referred to as bureau­
cracy. In fact, the most recent archeological evidence from 
Mesopotamia indicates that bureaucratic techniques emerged 
not just before sovereign states, but even before the existence 
of the first cities. They were not invented to manage scale, as 
ways of organizing societies that became too big for face-to­
face interaction. Rather, they seem to have been what encour­
aged people to assemble in such large communities to begin 
with. At least, this is what the record seems to show. The stan­
dardization of products, storage, certification, record-keeping, 
redistribution, and accounting all seem to have emerged in 
small towns along the Tigris and Euphrates and its tributaries 
in the fifth millennium BCE, a thousand years before the "urban 
revolu tion:'145 We don't really know how or why; we don't even 
know whether there were actual bureaucrats (in the sense of a 
distinct class of trained officeholders) or whether we are simply 
talking about the emergence of bureaucratic techniques. But 
by the time historical records do kick in there certainly are: 
we find vast temple and palace complexes with a hierarchy of 
trained scribes carefully registering and allocating resources 
of every sort. 
We can refer to the third principle as "politics" if one takes 
that word in what might be termed its maximal sense. Obvi­
ously, there is a minimal sense in which anything people do can 
be said to have a political aspect, insofar it involves jockeying for 
power. But there are only some social systems in which politics 
in this sense becomes a spectator sport in its own right: where 
powerful figures engage in constant public contests with one 
another as a way of rallying followers and gathering support. We 
176 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
now think of this as an aspect of democratic systems of govern­
ment, but for most of human history, it was seen as more of an 
aristocratic phenomenon. One need only think of the heroes 
of Homeric, or for that matter Germanic or Celtic or Hindu 
epics, who are constantly engaged in boasting, dueling, vying to 
organize the most splendid feasts or most magni ficent sacrifices, 
or to outdo one another with the giving of extravagant gifts.146 
Such "heroic" social orders, as they've been called, represent 
the quinte ssence of the political. They recognize no principle 
of sovereignty, but create no system of administration either; 
sometimes there is a high king but usually he has very limited 
power, or is a pure figureh ead; real power fluctuates continually 
as charismatic aristocrats assemble bands of followers, the most 
successful poaching off their riva ls' retinues, while others crash 
magnifice ntly, or decline into brooding obscurity. 
Politics in this sense has always been an essentially aristo­
cratic phenomenon. (There is a reason why the U.S. Senate, 
for exam ple, is inhabited entirely by millionaires .) This is why 
for most of European history , elections were assumed to be 
not a democratic, but an aristocratic mode of selecting pub­
lic officials. "Aristocracy" after all literally means "rule by the 
best," and· elections were seen as meaning that the only role 
of ordinary citizens was to decide which, among the "best" 
citizens, was to be considered best of all, in much the same way 
as a Homeric retainer, or for that matter, a Mongol horseman 
might switch allegiance to some new charismatic war-leader. 
(The democratic way of selecting officials, at least from Greek 
times onwards, was in contrast assumed to be sortition, whereby 
ordinary citizens were chosen for posts by random lotte ry.) 
What does all this have to do with dragons and wizards? 
Quite a lot, actu ally. Because all evidence we have suggests that 
such heroic orders did not just emerge spontaneou sly, along­
side bureaucratic societies; they emerged in a kind of symbi­
otic rivalry with them; and they were remembered long after 
177 The Utopia of Rules 
because they embodied a rejection of everything bureaucracy 
was supposed to be about. 
Here again I must return to archeolog y, and particu larly to the 
work of my friend DavidWengrow on the ancient Middle East.147 
The actual origins of what I'm calling "heroic societies" seem 
to lie on the hills, mountains, deserts, or steppes on the fringes 
of the great commercial-bureaucratic societies of Mesopotamia, 
Egypt, and the Indus Valley, and then, later, empires like Rome, 
Persia, or China. Economica lly, these societies were in many 
ways linked to the urban centers. They tended to supply the cit­
ies with raw materials, and to import all sorts of fabulous wealth 
and treasures from urban work shops. However, from quite early 
on, both sides also came to define themselves as everything 
the other one was not. Urbanites came to define civilization 
as not acting like a barbarian; the barbarians, in turn, ended up 
creating social orders that took the key values of commercial­
bureaucratic civilization and turned them precisely on their 
heads. Where one created and treasured literary masterworks, 
the other rejected the use of writing, but celebrated bards who 
could extemp orize works of epic verse afresh each time. Where 
one carefully stored and registered items of material value, the 
other sponsored vast potlatch-like festivals in which priceless 
treasures were either distributed to followers or rivals as a ges­
ture of contempt towards the pretentious of material wealth, 
or even abandone d, set on fire, or thrown into the sea. Where 
one developed a self -eff acing bureaucracy that offered predict­
able stabilit y, the other organized public life around charismatic 
egomaniacs in a never-ending struggle for supremacy. 
The original heroic societies emerged in the Bronze Age, 
and by the time of Plato, or Confucius, they must have been 
only very distant memories. Yet nonetheless, those memories 
remained vivid. Almost all the great literary traditions begin 
178 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
with heroic epics that are, essentiall y, later fanc iful reconstruc­
tions of what those Bronze Age heroic societies must have been 
like. We might well ask why this happened. Why did the very 
sorts of people ridiculed as ignorant barbarians by one civiliza­
tion of urbanites so often become reimagined as distant heroic 
ancestors of a later one? Why were stories of their exploits told 
and retold, in many cases, for thousands of years? 
I think part of the answer is that heroic societies are, effec­
tively, social orders designed to generate stories. This takes us 
back to questions about the very nature of politics. One might 
well argue that political action-and this is true even on the 
micro-l evel-is a matter of acting in a way that will influence 
other people at least partially by their hearing or finding out 
about it.148 Everyday politics-whether in a rural village or cor­
porate office-has everything to do with the manufacture of 
official narratives, rumors, and accounts. It stands to reason that · 
heroic societies, which turned political self-aggrandiz ement 
into an art form, would also have been organi zed in such a 
way as to become vast engines for the generation of stories. 
Everything was turned into a platf orm for some sort of contest, 
some narrative of persever ance, treache ry, revenge, impossible 
challenges, epic quests, or magnificent acts of self-sacrifice. This 
is why poets were so important. The whole point of life was 
to do things that other people might wish to sing about. Even 
from the beginning, the inhabitants of bureaucratic societies 
like Egypt or Babylonia could not help develop a certain fas­
cination with the barbarian hinterlands, which quickly became 
murky lands full of monsters and strange magical powers. And 
of course, dramatic stories about violent barbarians became 
even more compelling in ages when actual violent barbarians 
were no longer much around. 
Barbarians always exist in a symbiotic relation to bureaucratic 
civili zation. Over the course of Eurasian history , the pattern 
recurred again and again. Heroic societies formed at the fringes 
179 The Utopia of Rules 
of empire; often (like the Germanic societies that formed on 
the fringes of the Roman Imperium, or the Northern Barbar­
ians across the Great Wall from China, or the Huns that spent 
time on the borders of both) they would even sweep in and 
overwhelm those empires; in such cases, though, they would 
usually quickly dissolve away into legend.149 
Modern fantasy literature might be said to have its origins in 
late chivalric roma nces like Amadis of Gaul or Orlando Furioso, 
but the genre really takes recognizable form in the Victorian 
Age, around the same time as the height of popular enthusiasm 
for the postal service. It is set in a very peculiar sort of time. In a 
way, this time is just a modern version ofthe"once upon a time " 
of fairy tales, which was both a kind of floating, unspecified 
past, .. and another dimension existing simultaneously with our 
own (as many stories confirm, there are, still, portals between 
our world and fairyland, a land where time and space work 
entirely differentl y). But the temper of such fantasy literature 
is not at all the same. Fairy tales reflect a women's and chil­
dren's perspective on Medieval and Early Modern society; their 
heroes are more likely to be milkmaids and crafty cobblers' sons 
than courtiers and princes; in what has to be come to known 
as fantasy literature, in contrast, this "once upon a time" has 
been transformed entirely by a massive infusion of heroic epic. 
By "fantasy literature;' here, I am ref erring above all to what's 
sometimes called the "sword and sorcery" genre, whose origins 
lie in late Victorian figures like George MacDonald and Lord 
Duns any, and whose most shining avatars remain J.R.R. Tolk­
ien, C. S. Lewis, and Ursula K. Le Guin.150 It's within this tradi­
tion that the standard set of characters (warrior, cleric, mage) , 
types of spells, types of monstrous creature, etc., formed: a stan­
dard repertoire that recurs, in endless idiosyncratic variations, 
in hundreds if not thousands of works of contemporary fiction. 
These books are not just appealing because they create 
endless daydream material for the inhabitants of bureaucratic 
180 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
societies. Above all, they appeal because they continue to pro­
vide a systematic negation of everything bureaucracy stands for. 
Just as Medieval clerics and magicians liked to fantasize about a 
radiant celestial administrative system, so do we, now, fantasize 
about the adventures of Medieval clerics and mages, existing 
in a world in which every aspect of bureaucratic existence has 
been carefully stripped away. 
Why do we do so? We ll, the simplest explanation is that we 
are dealing with a form of ideological inoculati on. Historical ly, 
one of the most effective ways for a system of authority to 
tout its virtues is not to speak of them direc tly, but to create a 
particularly vivid image of their absolute negation-of what it 
claims life would be like in the total absence of, say, patriarchal 
author ity, or capitalism, or the state. As an ideological ploy, the 
trick works best when the image is on some level, profoundly 
app ealin g."' One is first drawn in to the vision of the alternative 
world, experiences a kind of vicarious thrill imagining it-only 
to ultimately recoil in horror at the impl ications of one's own 
desires. 
Roman games provide an excellent example. Until the 
coming of the empire, most Mediterranean cities had had some 
form of self-gove rnance, with public assemblies debating mat­
ters of public concern. In democraci es, even legal cases were 
tried by public juries consisting of hundreds of citizens. Under 
the Empire, of course, these were stripp ed of all authority , and 
eventually disappeared. Instead, the main occasion when large 
numbers of citizens assembled in public was at the Coliseum or 
the Circus, for chariot_ races or gladiatorial games , or 'to watch 
criminals be torn to pieces by wild animals. Insofar as those 
citizens had any experience of voting for anything, it was to put 
their thumbs up or down over the question of whether some 
defeated gladiator would be put to death . 
181 The Utopia of Rules 
In other word s, the Empire not only justified itself largely 
by imposing a uniform system of law over its subjects, it also 
made a point of encouraging those subjects to form organized 
lynch mobs (tbe games were often sponsored by the very mag­
istrates who presided over tbe courts) , as if to say; "Democracy? 
Now you know where that will lead." This was so effective tbat 
for the next two thousand years, warnings about the perils of 
democracy-and almost all educated Europeans for most of 
this period were staunchly opposed to democracy -insi sted 
that "the people" in such a system would inevitably end up 
behaving like the mob at tbe Roman circus: riven by violent 
factionalism, careening irrationally between extremes of mercy 
and crue lty, between blindly following charismatic idols and 
destroying them again. And to this day, almost all educated 
people still feel that, even if they are willing to grudgingly 
accept a few democratic elements in some aspects of soci ety, 
they need to be kept entirely separate from the administration 
of justice and the law. 
I don't want to leave the reader witb tbe impression that all 
such institutions are simply tricks set up by the ruling classes 
to manipulate the masses . Or that even insofar as they are, they 
can't backfire. The Roman circuses might have been unusually 
effective-they were truly one of the most brilliant antidemo­
cratic institutions ever created- but Medieval carnivals, to take 
one famous examp le, with their drunken celebration of glut­
tony, revolt, and sexua lity, were clearly contested ground. Its 
wealthier patrons no doubt saw carnival as a way of warning 
the masses of the horrors that might ensue were the hierarchi­
cal orders of society to dissolve, but it's obvious many of the 
common folk who were responsible for actually organizing and 
putting on the bulk of the celebrations did not see this prospect 
as nearly so horrible (indeed, carnivals often became the occa­
sion for actual revolts) .152 
No doubt fantasy literature, too, is contested ground. 
182 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
Its authors themselves were often unsure about the political 
implications of their work. J.R.R. Tolkien for example once 
remarked that political ly, he was either an anarchist, or an 
''uncon stitutional" monarchis t-. it seems he could never make 
up his mind quite which. 153 The one thing both positions have 
in common of course is that they are both profoundly anti­
bureaucratic. This is true of almost all fantasy literature: only evil 
people maintain systems of administrati on. In fact, one could 
survey the key features of fantasy literature point by point and 
see each as a precise negation of some aspect of bureaucracy: 
Fantasy worlds tend to be marked by an absolute di­
vision of good and evil (or at best, ambigtious good 
and absolute evil) , implying the existence of forces 
between which war is the only possible relationship. 
In fact, when it comes to conflict with such absolute 
villains, even war tends to be absolute, unmediated by 
custom, etiquette, or chivalry. This is in striking con­
trast either with heroic or Medieval societies, where 
organized violence-an aristocratic pastime-tended 
more of ten to resemble a ritualized game in which 
honor was everything. The principle of absolute evil 
seems to exist to negate the bureaucratic princi­
ple of value-free rule-bound neutrality, the fact 
that principles such as good and evil are utterly alien 
to administrative orders of any kind. Fantasy worlds 
create values so absolute it is simply impossible to be 
value-free. 
The existence in fantasy universes of demi-human 
species-gnomes, drew, trolls, and so on-which are 
fundamentally human, but absolutely impossible to in­
tegrate under the same larger social, legal, or political 
order, creates a world where racism is actually true. 
Often the language of race is directly invoked: "the 
183 The Utopia of Rules 
184 race of elves," "the race of dwarves," and so on. Even 
when it is not, these are worlds where there actually 
are different stocks of humanoid creatures who can 
speak, build houses, cultivate food, create art and ritu­
als, that is, who look and act basically like humans, but 
who nonetheless have prof oundly different moral and 
intellectual quali ties. This is among other things the 
absolute negation of the bureaucratic principle of 
indiff erence, that the rules are the same for everyone, 
that it shouldn't matter who your parents are, that ev­
eryone must be treated equally before the law. If some 
people are ores and others are pixies, equal treatment 
is ipso facto inconc eivable. 
Legitimate power in fantasy worlds tends to be based 
on· pure charisma, or the memory of past charisma. 
Aragorn never coerces anyone to follow him. Neither 
does Asian. Or Ged. Only bad guys ever create a state­
like appar atus, and when they do, that apparatus is one 
of pure coercion. What's more, charismatic authority 
that is not constantly renewed tends to wither and 
become corrupt (e.g., Denethor, Gormenghast) , or 
develop into creepy, .Gothic, undead forms. Since the 
very possibility of real, vital, charismatic authority is al­
ways founded on war, this means legitimate authority 
is itself impossible without constant physical insecurity. 
In other words, the political ideal of modern "demo­
cratic" Repub lics, in which politicians constantly vie 
for followers, is maintained -hardly surprising ly, since 
as I emphasized this was always the heroic/aristocratic 
element in such Republics anywa y-but it is entirely 
divorc ed both from principles of sovereignty, and 
above all, from the regularity and predictability 
of bureaucratic procedures, and the routiniza­
tion of force, which in a bureaucratic order is The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
seen as legitimate only insofar as it is used to 
uphold that principle of regularity. In short, in 
fantasy worlds, truly legitimate figures of authority are 
usually violent, but they don't employ violence to en­
force the rules. 
• As a corollary: in fantasy, as in heroic societies, political 
life is largely about the creation of stories. Narratives 
are embedded inside narratives; the storyli ne of a typi­
cal fantasy is often itself about the process of telling 
stories, interpreting stories, and creating material for 
new ones. This is in dramatic contrast with the me­
chanical nature of bureaucratic operations. Ad­
ministrative procedures are very much not about the 
creation of stories; in a bureaucratic setting, stories ap­
pear when something goes wrong. When things run 
smoot hly, there's no narrative arc of any sort at all. 
What's more, protagonists are endlessly engaging 
with riddles in ancient languages, obscure myths and 
prophecies, maps with runic puzzles and the like. Bu­
reaucratic procedures in contrast are based on a prin­
ciple of transparency. The rules are supposed to be 
clear, unif ormly expressed, and accessible to all. As we 
all know, this is rarely actually the case. But it is sup­
posed to be true in principle. For most of us, admin­
istrative forms are at least as obscure as elvish riddles 
that only become visible at certain phases of the moon. 
But they are not supposed to be. In fact, one of the 
most infuriating bureaucratic tactics is to disguise in­
formation through a false pretense of transparency: for 
instance, to bury a key piece of inf ormation in a flurry 
of departmental emails-so many that no one could 
possibly read all of them. When we complain that we 
were not informed of a new policy or responsibility, 
the bureaucrats triumphantly produce the date (usu-
185 The Utopia of Rules 
ally months in the past) and details of the documents 
where the new rules were listed.154 Compared to this, 
there is certainly a kind of pleasure in the fantasy ma­
terials: puzzles actually are puzzles, they are supposed 
to be puzzles, and there is no officious person who 
will show up to lecture you on how this is all perfectly 
transparent and simple and there's obviously some­
thing wrong with you for not having immediately 
figured it out. 
As the last example makes clear, when we discuss these con­
stants, we are speaking of a certain abstract ideal of how 
bureaucratic systems should work, not the way they actually 
do. In reality, bureaucracies are rarely neutral; they are almost 
always dominated by or favor certain privileged groups (often 
racial groups) over others; and they invariably end up giv­
ing administrators enormous individual personal power by 
producing rules so complex and contradictory that they can­
not possibly be followed as they stand. Yet in the real world, 
all these departures from bureaucratic principle are expe­
rienced as abuses. In fantasy worlds, they are experienced as 
virtue s. 
Still, those virtues are clearly intended to be fleeting. Fanta­
syland is a thrilling place to visit. Few of us would really want 
to live there. But if I am right that-whatever the authors' 
intentions-such literature largely ends up operating in such a 
way as to cause readers to question the ultimate implications of 
their own suspicions of bureaucratic existence, this is precisely 
the point. 
Fantasy literature then, is largely an attempt to imagine a world 
utterly purged of bureauc racy, which readers enjoy both as a 
form of vicarious escapism and as reassurance that ultimatel y, 
186 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
a boring, administered world is probably preferable to any imag­
inable alternative. 
Still, bureaucracy and bureaucratic principles are not entirely 
absent from such worlds. They creep in from several dir ections. 
For one thing, the old imaginary cosmic administration of 
the Middle Ages is not entirely negated in most fantasy worlds. 
This is because these are almost invariably worlds where, though 
technology is limited to the wind and water mill level, magic 
actually wor ks.And the type of magic that appears in the stories 
tends most often to be drawn from the We stern ceremonial 
magic tradition that runs from ancient theurgists like Iamblichus 
to Victorian mages like MacGregor Mathers, full of demons 
invoked in magic circles, chants, spells, robes, talismans, scrolls, 
and wands. So the cosmic hierarchies, the complex logical orders 
of spells, orders, powers, influences, celestial spheres with their 
different powers and denominations and areas of administrative 
responsibility: all these tend to be preserved, in one form or 
another, as at least one hidden potential form of power within 
the fabric of the antibureaucratic universe itself. True, in the 
earliest, and most resolutely antibureaucratic univers es, sorcer­
ers are either evil (Zukala in Conan the Barbarian or a million 
similar pulp fiction villains, or even Michael Moorcock's amoral 
Elric),155 or, if they are good, the technical aspect of their art is 
minimized (Gandal f's power seems to be an extension of his 
personal charisma rather than deriving from arcane knowledge 
of spells) . But as time moved on from there to The Wizard of 
Earthsea to Harry Potter, magic-and magical knowledge-took 
more and more a central place. And of course by the time we 
get to Harry Potter, we have also traveled all the way from 
expressly heroic realms like Cimmeria or Elfland or Hyper­
borea, to an antibureaucratic narrative that's set within a classic 
bureaucratic institution: a British boarding school, in a magical 
world that is nonetheless replete with banks, Wizard Boards, 
Commissions of Enquir y, and even prisons. In the Harry Potter 
187 The Utopia of Rules 
books, that's exactly the joke: let's take the most drab, stuffy, 
institutions responsible for the disenchantment of the world, 
and try to concoct the most wildly enchanted versions of them 
we can possibly imagine. 
How could this have happened? We ll, one reason is that 
genres of popular fiction are increasingly not confined to books. 
(This is especially true if children or adolescents are in any way 
involve d.) Nor do they just extend into movies and television 
series: there are also everything from board games to models, 
puzzles, and action figure s, mult iple forms of fan literature, 
zines, fan art, video and computer games . In the case of the 
fantasy genre, it's impossible to understand the later dire ction of 
the literature without first of all understanding the rise, in the 
late seventies, of the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, 
which allowe d hundreds of thousands of teenagers across the 
world to effectively improvise their own fantasy worlds and 
fantasy adve ntur es, as if they were colle ctively writing the story 
or script of their own adventures in real time. 
D&D, as its aficionados call it, is on one level the most free­
form game imaginable, since the characters are allowed to do 
absolutely anything, within the confines of the world created 
by the Dungeon Master, with his books, maps, and tables and 
preset towns, castles, dungeons, wild erness. In many ways it's 
actually quite anarchistic, since unlike classic war games where 
one commands armies, we have what anarchists would call 
an "affinity group," · a band of individuals cooper ating with a 
common purpose (a quest, or simply the desire to accumulate 
treasure and experi ence), with complementary abilities (fighter, 
cleric, magic-user, thief ... ), but no explicit chain of command. 
So the social relations are the very opposite of impersonal 
bureaucratic hierarc hies. However, in another sense, D&D 
represents the ultimate bureaucratization of antibureaucratic 
fantasy. There are catalogs for everything: types of monsters 
(stone giants, ice giants, fire giants ... ), each with carefully 
188 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
tabulated powers and average· number of hit points (how hard it 
is to kill them) ; human abilities (strength , intelligence, wisdom, 
dexter ity, constitution ... ); lists of spells avai lable at differ ent 
levels of capacity (magic missile, fireball, passwall ... ); types of 
gods or demons; effectiveness of different sorts of armor and 
weapons; even moral character (one can be lawful, neutral, or 
chaotic; good, neutral, or evil; combining these produces nine 
possible basic moral types ... ). The books are distantly evo ca­
tive of Medieval bestiaries and grimoir es. But they are largely 
composed of statistics. All important qualities can be reduced 
to number. It's also true that in actual play, there are no rules; 
the books are just guidelines; the Dungeon Master can (indeed 
really ought to) play around with them, inventing new spells, 
monsters, and a thousand variations on existing ones. Every 
Dungeon Master's universe is diff erent. The numbers are in a 
sense a platform for crazy feats of the imagination, themselves 
a kind of poetic technolo gy. 
Still, the introduction of numbers, the standardization of 
types of character, ability, monster, treasure, spell, the concept 
of ability scores and hit-points, had profound effects when one 
moved from the world of 6-, 8-, 12- and 20-sided dice to one 
of digital interfa ces. Computer games could turn fantasy into an 
almost entirely bureaucratic procedure: accumulation of points, 
the raising oflevels, and so on. There was a return to the com­
mand of armies. This in turn set off a move in the other direc­
tion, by introducing role-playing back into the computer games 
(Elf quest, Wo rld ofW arcraft ... ), in a constant weaving back 
and forth of the imperatives of poetic and bureaucratic tech­
nology. But in doing so, these games ultimately reinforce the 
sense that we live in a universe where accou nting procedures 
define the very fabric of reality, where even the most absolute 
negation of the administered world we're currently trap ped in 
can only end up being yet another version of the exact same 
thing. 
189 The Utopia of Rules 
IV. The Utopia of Rules 
One reason I have seen fit to spend so much time on fantasy 
worlds is because the topic opens up some fundamental ques­
tions about the nature of play, games, and freedom-all of which, 
I believe, lie at the core of bureaucracy' s covert appeal. One the 
one hand, a bureaucracy is anything but play ful. Mechanistic 
and impersonal, it would appear to represent the negation of 
any possibility of playf ulness. On the other hand, being trap ped 
in a bureaucratic runaround feels very much like being caught 
inside some kind of horrific game. 
Bureaucracies create games-they're just games that are in 
no sense fun. But it might be useful here to think more care­
fully about what games really are, and what it is that makes 
them fun in the first place. First of all, what is the relationship 
between play and games? We play games. So does that mean 
play and games are really the same thing? It's certainly true that 
the English language is somewhat unusual for even making the 
distinction between the two-in most languages, the same word 
covers both. (This is true eve n of most European languages, as 
with the French jeu or German spiele.) But on another level 
they seem to be opposites, as one suggests free-form creativity; 
the other, rules. 
The great Dutch sociologist Johann Huizinga wrote a book 
called Homo Ludens that is ostensibly a theory of play. In fact, 
the book makes for a very bad theory of play, but it's not at 
all a bad theory of games.156 According to Huizinga, games 
have certain common features. First, they are clearly bounded 
in time and space, and thereby framed off from ordinary life. 
There is a field, a board, a starting pistol, a finish line. Within 
that time /space, certain people are designated as players. There 
are also rules, which define precisely what those players can and 
cannot do. Finally, there is always some clear idea of the stakes, 
of what the players have to do to win the game. And, critically: 
190 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
that's all there is.Any place, person, action, that falls outside that 
:framework is extr aneous; it doeSn't matter; it's not part of the 
game. Another way to put this would be to say that games are 
pure rule-gove rned action. 
It seems to me this is 'important, because this precisely why 
games are fun. In almost any other aspect of human existence, 
all these things are ambigu ous. Think of a family quarrel, or 
a work place rivalry. Who is or is not a party to it, what's fair, 
when it began and when it's over, what it even means to say 
you won-it's all extremely difficult to say. The hardest thing 
of all is to understand the rules. In almost any situation we find 
ourselves in, there are rules-even in casual conv ersation, there 
are tacit rules of who can speak in what order, pacing, tone, 
deference, appropriate and inapprop riate topics, when you can 
smile, what sort of humor is allowable, what you should be 
doing with your eyes, and a million other things besides. These 
rules are rarely explicit, and usually there are many conflict­
ing ones that could, possibl y, be brought to bear at any given 
moment. So we are always doing the difficult work of negotiat­
ing between them, and trying to predict how others will do the 
same. Games allow us our only real exp erience of a situation 
where all this ambiguity is swept away. Everyone knows exactly 
what the rules are. And not only that, people actually do follow 
them.And by following them, it is even possible to win! This­
along with the fact that unlike in real life, one has submitted 
oneself to the rules· completely voluntarily-is the source of 
the pleasure. 
Games, then, are a kind of utopia of rules. 
This is also how we can understand the real difference be­
tween games and play. True, one can play a game; but to speak 
of "play" does not necessarily imply the existence of rules at 
all. 157 Play can be purely improv isationa l. One could simply be 
playing around. In this . sense, play in its pure form, as distinct 
from game s, implies a pure expr ession of creative energy. In fact, 
191 The Utopia of Rules 
if it were possible to come up with a workable definition of 
"play" (this is notoriously diffi cult) it would have to be some­
thing along these lines: play can be said to be present when the 
free expression of creative energies becomes an end in itself. It 
is freedom for its own sake. But this also makes play in a certain 
sense a higher-level concept than games: play can create gam es, 
it can generate rules-in fact , it inevitably does produce at least 
tacit ones, since sheer random playing around soon becomes 
boring- but therefore by definition play cannot itselfbe intrin­
sically rule-bound. This is all the more true when play becomes 
social. Studies of children's play, for example, inevitably discover 
that children playing imaginary games spend at least as much 
time arguing about the rules than they do actually playing them. 
Such arguments become a form of play in themselv es."' 
On one level, all this is obv ious: we are just talking about the 
emergence of form. Freedom has to be in tension with some­
thing, or it's just randomne ss. This suggests that the absolute 
pure form of pla y, one that really is absolutely untrammeled by 
rules of any sort (other than those it itself generates and can set 
aside at any instance) itself can exist only in our imaginati on, as 
an aspect of those divine powers that generate the cosmos. 
Here's a quote from Indian philosopher of science Shiv 
Visvanathan: 
A game is a bounded, specific way of problem solving. 
Play is more cosmic and open-ended. Gods play, but 
man unfortunately is a gaming indivi dual. A game has 
a predictable resolution, play may not. Play allows for 
emergence, novelty, surprise. 159 
All true. But there is also something pote ntially terrifying 
about play for just this reason. Because this open,ended creativ­
ity is also what allows it to be randomly destructive. Cats play 
with mice. Pulling the wings off flies is also a form of play. 
192 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
Playf ul gods are rarely ones any sane person would desire to 
encounter. 
Let me put forth a suggestion, then. 
What ultimately lies behind the appeal of bureaucracy is fear 
of play. 
For the social theorist, there is one obvious analogy to play as 
a principle that generates rules, but is not itself bound by them. 
This is the principle of sovereignty . The reader will remem­
ber sovereignty was one of the three principles-along with 
administration and politics-that ultimately came together 
in our current notion of "the state." The term "sovereignty" 
is mostly used in political theory nowadays as a synonym for 
"independen ce" or "autonomy"-the right of a government 
to do what it likes within its own borders-but it originally 
emerged from very specific European debates about the power 
of kings. Basical ly, the question was: is it possible to say that the 
supreme ruler of a kingdom is in any sense bound by its laws? 
Those who argued that sovereigns were not bound by those 
laws drew an analogy with divine power. God is the creator, 
and ultimate enforcer, of any system of cosmic morality. But 
in order to create a system, one must be prior to it; for this 
reason God himself cannot be bound by moral laws . This is not 
at all an unusual conclusion. In Madagascar, proverbial wisdom 
was quite explicit about this: God was represented as both 
the ultimate jud ge-watching from on high and punishing 
transgressions-and simulta neousl y, as a completely arbitrary 
figure tossing lightning bolts and blasting mortals for no reason 
whatsoever. Occasional African kings tried ro make themselves 
human embodiments of this absolute principle: the most famous 
examp le was the Kabaka of the Ganda kingdom. When he met 
with English visitors who tried to impress him by presenting 
him with some new efficient English rifle, he would, in turn, 
193 The Utopia of Rules 
impress them by testing the rifle out on random sub jects on 
the street. (He was also known to execute his wives for sneez­
ing.) Yet at the same time, the Kabaka's legitimacy, as monarch, 
lay above all in his reputation for imposing impartial justice in 
his capacity as the kingdom's highest court judge. Again, the 
two were seen as connected: since the King could do (or take) 
absolutely anything he wanted, he also could not be bribed, so 
he really had no reason not to be impartial. The Ganda kingdom 
was unusual in taking the principle to such extremes (and it 
should be noted that in Africa, kings who did take things this far 
almost invariably came to a bad end eventuall y), but still, there 
is a direct line of continuity between this absolute conception 
of transcendent sovereignty and, say, Carl Schmitt's "Political 
Theol ogy," which argues that in' modern states, sovereign power 
is ultimately the power to set aside the laws. 160 
Sovereignty in this sense is ultimately identical to play as 
the generative principle that produces games; but if so, it is also 
play in its most terrifying, cosmic form. Some have called this 
the notion of"top-down" play, a concept that seems to be most 
explicitly devel oped in Indian theology, where the cosmos itself 
is essentially the play of the divine forces. 161 But as Brian Sutton­
Smith notes in his book The Ambiguit ies ef Play, this was the 
dominant view throughout the ancient world, where human 
beings were the playthings of destiny and fate; the exemplary 
human game, in such a universe, is gambling, where we willingly 
submit ourselves to the random whims of the gods.162 
In such a universe, freedom really is a zero-sum game. The 
freedom of gods or kings is the measure of human slavery. 
It shouldn't be hard to see where all this is going. Modern states 
are based on a principle of popular sovereignty. Ultimately, 
the divine power of kings is in the hands of an entity called 
"the people." In practice, though, it's increasingly unclear what 
194 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
popular sovereignty in that sense is even supposed to mean. Max 
We ber famously pointed out that a sovereign state's institutional 
representatives maintain a monopoly on the right of violence 
within the state's terr itor y.163 Norm ally, this violence can only 
be exercised by certain duly authorized officials (soldiers, police, 
jailers), or those authorized by such officials (airport securit y, 
private guards ... ), and only in a manner expl icitly designated 
by law. But ultimately, sovereign power really is, still, the right 
to brush such legalities aside, or to make them up as o;,_e goes 
along. 164 The United States might call itself "a country oflaws, 
not men," but as we have learned in recent years, American 
presidents can order torture, assassinations, domestic surveillance 
programs, even set up extra-legal zones like Guantanamo where 
they can treat prisoners pretty much any way they choose to. 
Even on the lowest levels, those who enforce. the law are not 
really subject to it. It's extraordinary difficult, for instance, for a 
police officer to do anythin g to an American citizen that would 
lead to that officer being convicted of a crime. 165 
Brian Sutton-Sm ith argues that in the contemporary world 
the older, "top-down" view of play, what some have calle d" dark 
play;' no longer really holds sway. Since the Romantic era, it has 
been largely replaced by a whole host of more cheerful bottom­
up rhetorics that see play variously as subversive, or educational, 
or imaginative. No doubt all this is true. But it seems to me that 
the older conception has· not vanished entirely. 166 If nothing 
else, it is preserved on a political level, where. every arbitrary 
act of power tends to reinforce a feeling that it's not power, but 
arbitrarines s-that is, freedom itself-that is the problem. 167 
This is, indeed, almost precisely what has happened wher­
ever the republican form of government (now largely misla­
beled "democracy") has become the nor m.The legal order, and 
hence the zones where state violence is the ultimate enforcer 
of the rules, has expanded to define and regulate almost every 
possible aspect of human activity. Thus, as I've said earlier, we 
195 The Utopia of Rules 
end up with regulations prescribing everything from where 
one can serve or consume diff erent sorts of beverages, how 
one can work, when one can and can't walk off from work, to 
the size of advertisements visible from the street. The threat of 
force invades practically every aspect of our existence, in ways 
that would have simply been inconc eivable under the rule of 
Elagabalus, Genghis Khan or Suleiman the Magnifi cent. 
I've already written about this invasion of regulati on, and 
violence, into every aspect of our lives.What I want to argue here 
is that this imperative ultimately derives from a tacit cosmology 
in which the play principle (and by extension, creativity) is itself 
seen as frightening, while game-like behavior is celebrated as 
transparent and predictable, and wher e as a result, the advance 
of all these rules and regulations is itself experienced as a kind 
of freedom. 
This occurs even in contexts where the threat of state vio­
lence is maximally far away. A good example is the management 
of academic departments. As I've discussed, anthropologists are 
notoriously reluctant to turn their tools of analysis on their 
own institutional enviro nments, but there are exceptions, and 
one excellent one is Marilyn Strathern's analysis of what in the 
UK has come to be known as "audit culture." The basic idea 
behind audit culture .is that in the absence of clear, "transparent" 
criteria to understand how people are going about their jobs, 
academia simply becomes a feudal system based on arbitrary 
personal authority. On the surf ace, it's hard to argue with this. 
Who could be against transparency? Strathern was head of the 
anthropology department at Cambridge when these reforms 
were imp osed, and in her book Audit Cultures, she documented 
the actual consequences of this kind of bureaucratization. 168 
Cambridge was in its own way the quintessential feudal institu­
tion, with an endless accretion of customs and tradit ions, and 
anthropology, though a relatively new department, had its own 
traditional ways of going about everything that no one could 
196 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
entirely articulate; indeed, that no one completely under stood. 
But in order to become "transparent" to the administra tion, they 
had to start articulating them; in practi ce, what this meant was 
that they had to take what had always been a subtle, nuanced 
form of procedures and turn them into an explicit set of rules. 
In effec t, they had to turn custom into a kind of board game. 
Faced with such demands, everyone's first impulse was just to 
say, "Wel l, sure, we'll just write that for the authorities and pro­
ceed as we always have." But in practice this quickly becomes . 
impossible, because the moment any conflicts crop up, both 
parties will automatically appeal to the rule-book. 
Such reforms may aim to eliminate arbitrary personal 
authority , but of course they never actually do. Personal author­
ity just jumps up a level, and becomes the ability to set the rules 
aside in specific cases (a sort of miniature version of sovereign 
power again) . However, in practice, the fact that the reforms do 
not in any sense achieve their stated goals doesn't have the eff ect 
of undermining their legitimacy . Instead, the effect is quite the 
opposite, since anyone who objects to such personalized power 
can only do so by demanding even more rules and even more 
"transparency ." Suddenly, freedom and justice real ly do become 
a matter of reducing everything to a game. 
If we think about it, this sort of thing happens all the time­
and even in contexts that have nothing to do with arbitrary 
personal authorit y. The most obvious example is language. Call 
it the grammar-b ook effect. People do not invent languages 
by writing grammars, they write grammars--<it least, the first 
grammars to be written for any given language-by observ­
ing the tacit, largely unconscious, rules that people seem to be 
applying when they speak.Y et once a book exists , and especially 
once it is employed in schoolrooms, people feel that the rules 
are not just descriptions of how people do talk, but prescrip­
tions for how they should talk. 
It's easy to observe this phenomenon in places where 
197 The Utopia of Rules 
grammars were only written recent ly. In many places in the 
world, the first grammars and dictionaries were created by 
Christian missionaries in the nineteenth or even twentieth 
cent ury, intent on translating the Bible and other sacred texts 
into what had been unwritten languages. For instance, the first 
gramm ar for Malagasy, the language spoken in Madagascar, was 
written in the r8ros and '20s. Of course, language is changing 
all the time, so the Malagasy spoken language--even its gram­
mar-is in many ways quite different than it was two hundred 
years ago. However, since everyone learns the grammar in 
school, if you point this out, people will automatically say that 
speakers nowadays are simply making mistakes, not following 
the rules corre ctly. It never seems to occur to anyone--until 
you point it out-that had the missionaries came and written 
their books two hundred years later, current usages would be 
considered the only correct ones, and anyone speaking as they 
had two hundred years ago would themselves be assumed to be 
1n error. 
In fact, I found this attitude made it extremely difficult to 
learn how to speak colloquial Malagasy. Even when I hired 
native speakers, say, students at the university, to give me lessons, 
they would teach me how to speak nineteenth-century Mala­
gasy as it was taught in school. As my proficiency improved, 
I began noticing that the way they talked to each other was 
nothing like the way they were teaching me to speak. But when 
I asked them about grammatical forms they used that weren't 
in the books, they'd just shrug them off, and say, "Oh, that's just 
slang, don't say that." In the end I found the only way I could 
really learn contemporary spoken Malagasy was to tape-record 
conversations, try to trans cribe them myself, and then ask 
friends to clarify every time I came across an unfamiliar usage 
or expr ession. Nothing else would work: once they had decided 
these grammatical forms were errors, they simply could not 
describe them to me in grammatical terms. 
198 The l!to pia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
In the case of the Cambridge anthropology department, the 
rules were made explicit, and were then frozen in place, osten­
sibly as a way of eliminating arbitrary, personal authority. These 
reforms clearly have nothing to do with a distaste for arbitrary 
authority , and everything to do with a distaste for arbitrariness 
itself -a distaste which leads to an unthinking acceptance of 
authority in its most formal, institutional form. After all, what 
is our first exp erience of formal, rule-gov erned authority if not 
our grade-s chool teachers? This is as much true in Madagascar 
as anywhere else. In fact, when I asked my friends why people 
didn't really speak the language describ ed in the text books, the 
inevitable reply was always to the effect of "well, you know, 
people are lazy." Clear ly, the problem was that the entire popu­
lation had failed to memorize their lessons properly. But what 
they were actually denying was the legitimacy of colle ctive 
creati vity, the free play of the system. 
It's worth thinking about language for a moment, because 
one thing it reveals, probably better than any other example, is 
that there is a basic paradox in our very idea of freedom. On 
the one hand, rules are by their nature constraining. Speech 
codes, rules of etiquette, and grammatical rules, all have the 
effect oflimiting what we can and cannot say. It is not for noth­
ing that we all have the picture of the schoolmarm rapping a 
child across the knuckles for some grammatical error as one of 
our primordial images of oppressio n. But at the same time, if 
there were no shared conventions of any kind-no semantics, 
syntax, phonemics -we'd all just be babbling incoherently and 
wouldn't be able to communicate with each other at all. Obvi­
ously in such circumstances none of us would be free to do 
much of anything. So at some point along the way, rules-as­
constraining pass over into rules-as-enabling, even if it's impos­
sible to say exactly where. Freedom, then, really is the tension of 
the free play of human creativity against the rules it is constantly 
generating. And this is what linguists always observe. There is 
199 The Utopia of Rules 
no language without grammar. But there is also uo language in 
which everything, including grammar, is not constantly chang­
ing all the time. 
We rarely ask ourselves why that should be. Why is it that 
languages always change? It's easy enough to see why we need 
to have common agreements on grammar and vocabulary in 
order to be able to talk to one other. But if that's all that we need 
language for, one would think that, once a given set of speakers 
found a grammar and vocabulary that suited their purposes, 
they'd simply stick with it, perhaps changing the vocabulary 
around if there was some new thing to talk about-a new trend 
or invention, an imported vegetable-but otherwis e, leaving 
well enough alone. In fact, this never happens. We don't know 
of a single recorded example of a language that, over the course 
of, say, a century; did not change both in sound and structur e.169 
This is true even of the languages of the most "traditional" soci­
eties ; it happens even where elaborate institutional structures 
have been create d-like grammar schools, or the Academie 
Franvaise-to ensure that it does not. No doubt some of this 
is the result of sheer rebelliousness (young people trying to set 
themselves off from elders, for example) but it's hard to escape 
the conclusion that ultimatel y, what we are really confronting 
here is the play principle in its purest form. Human beings , 
whether they speak Arapesh, Hopi, or Norwegian, just find it 
boring to say things the same way all the time. They're always 
going to play around at least a little. And this playing around 
will always have cumulative effects. 
What this suggests is that people, everywhere, are prone to 
two completely contradictory tendencies: on the one hand, 
a tendency to be playfully creative just for the sake of it; on 
the other, a tendency to agree with anyone who tells them 
that they really shouldn't act that way. This latter is what makes 
the game-ification of institutional life possible. Because if you 
take the latter tendency to its logical conclusion, all freedom 
200 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
becomes arbitra riness, and all arbitrar iness, a form of danger ous, 
subversive power. It is just one further step to argue that true 
freedom is to live in an utterly predictable world that is free 
from freedom of this sort. 
Let me fini sh with another example from my own political 
experience. 
Over the last thirty or forty years, anti-authoritarians around 
the world have been working on creating new, and more effec­
tive, modes of direct democracy-ones that might operate 
without any need for a bureaucracy of violence to enforce 
them. I've written about these efforts extensively elsewhere. 
A lot of progress has been made. But those working on such 
projects often find themselves having to deal with exactly 
this sort of horror of "arbitrary" power. Part of the work of 
developing new forms of consensus process, for example, is to 
create institutional forms that encourage, rather than inhibi t, 
improvis ation and creativity . As activists sometimes put it: in 
most circumsta nces, if you bring together a crowd of people, 
that crowd will, as a group, behave less intelligen tly, and less 
creati vely, than any single member of the crowd is likely to do 
if on their own. Activist decision -making process is, instead, 
designed to make that crowd smarter and more imaginative 
than any individual participant. 
It is indeed possible to do this, but it takes a -lot of work. 
And the larger the group, the more formal mechanisms have to 
be put in place. The single most important essay in this whole 
activist tradition is called "The Tyranny of Structurele ssness;'110 
written in the 1970s by Jo Freeman, about organizational crises 
that occurred in early feminist consciousness-raising circles 
when those groups began to attain a cert �in size. Freeman 
observed that such groups always started out with a kind of 
rough-and-ready anar chism, an assumption that there was no 
201 The Utopia of Rules 
need for any formal, parliamentary rules- of-order type mecha­
nisms at all. People would just sit down in a sisterly manner 
and work things out. And this was, indeed, what happened at 
first. However, as soon as the groups grew to over, say, twenty 
people, informal cliques invariably began to emerge, and small 
groups of friends or allies began controlling information, setting 
agendas, and wielding power in all sorts of subtle ways. Freeman 
proposed a number of diff erent formal mechanisms that might 
be employed to counteract this effect, but for present purposes, 
the specifics don't really matter. Suffice it to say that what is 
now ref erred to as "formal consensus process" largely emerges 
from the crisis Freeman described, and the debate her interven­
tion set off. 
What I do want to bring attention to is that almost every­
one who is not emerging from an explicitly anti-authoritarian 
position-and no insignificant number even of those who 
are-c ompletely misread Freeman's essay, and interpret it not as 
a plea for formal mechanisms to ensure equality, but as a plea for 
more transparent hierarch y. Leninists are notorious for this sort 
of thing, but Liberals are just as bad. I can't tell you how many 
arguments I've had about this. They always go exactly the same 
way. First, Freeman's argument about the formation of cliques 
and invisible power structures is taken as an argument that any 
group of over twenty people will always have to have cliques, 
power structures, and people in authori ty. The next step is to 
insist that if you want to minimize the power of such cliques, 
or any deleterious effects those power structures might have, 
the only way to do so is to institutional ize them: to take the de 
facto cabal and turn them into a central committee (or, since 
that term now has a bad history, usually they say a coordinating 
committee, or a steering committee, or something of that sort.) 
One needs to get power out of the shadows-to formalize the 
process, make up rules, hold elections, specify exactly what the 
cabal is allowed to do and what it's not. In this way, at least, 
202 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucr�cy After All 
power will be made transparent and "acco untabl e:' (Notice that 
word again. It comes from accountancy procedures .) It won't in 
any sense be arbitrary . 
From a practical , activist perspective, this prescription is 
obviously ridiculous. It is far easier to limit the degree to which 
informal cliques can wield effective power by granting them no 
formal status at all, and therefore no legitimacy; whatever "for­
mal accountability structures" it is imagined will contain the 
cliques-now-turned-committees can only be far less effective 
in this regard, not least because they end up legitimating and 
hence massively increasing the diff erential access to informa­
tion which allows some in otherwise egalitarian groups to have 
greater power to begin with. As I pointed out in the first essay, 
structures of transparency inevita bly, as I've described, begin to 
become structures of stupidity as soon as that takes place. 
So say one argues this point, and the critic concedes it 
(which usually they have to because it's pretty much com­
mon sense) . If so, the next line of defense is generally aesthet ic: 
the critic will insist it's simply distasteful to have structures of 
real power that are not recognized and that can, even if they 
entirely lack any degree of violent enforcement, be considered 
arbitrary . Usually, one's interlocutor won't go so far as actually 
admitting their objections are aesthet ic. U sually they will frame 
their arguments in moral terms. But occasiona lly, you will find 
some honest enough to admit that's what's going on. I well 
remember having an Occu py Wall Street-sponsored debate in 
Central Park (I'm sure it's recorded somewhere) with Norman 
Finkelstein-a brilliant and altogether admirable activist, who 
had come of age with the Civil Rights Movement and still 
saw groups like the Southern Christian Leadership Conf erence 
as his inspiration. At this debate, Finkelstein stated the matter 
outright. Maybe it's true, he admitted, that the best way to keep 
such cliques from attaining too much power is to maintain a 
principle that they should not exist. But as long as such cliques 
203 The Utopia of Rules 
are allowed to exist without being formally acknowledged and 
regulated, you're maintaining a system that says it's okay to be 
gov erned, even a tiny bit, from the shadows. It might not be 
that much of a practical probl em. You might well be right that 
formally recognizing their existence might actually end up cre­
ating less overall freedom than leaving well enough alone. But 
in the final analysis, I just find the idea of being governed from 
the shadows, in any sense, distastef ul. 
In such argu ments, we are witnessing a dire.ct clash between 
two diff erent forms of materialized utopianism: on the one 
hand, an anti-authoritarianism that, in its emphasis on creative 
synthesis and improv isation, sees freedom basically in terms of 
play, and on the other, a tacit republ icanism that sees freedom 
ultimately as the ability to redu ce all forms of power to a set of 
clear and transparent rules. 
For the last two hundred years, in Europe and North Amer­
ica-and increasing ly, elsewhere-that latter, bureaucratized 
notion of freedom has tended to hold sway. New institutional 
arrangements that operate by rules so strict and predictable 
they essentially disappear, so that one doesn't even know what 
they are (such as the physi cal or electronic post offices with 
which I began) tend to be put forward as platforms for human 
freedom that emerge from the very technical contingencies 
of running efficient structures of power. These arrangements 
seem to preserve the positive elements of play while somehow 
circumventing its more disturbing potentials. 
But time and again, we have seen the same results. Whether 
motivated by a faith in "rationality" or a fear of arbitrary power, 
the end result of this bureaucratized notion of freedom is to 
move toward the dream of a world where play has been lim­
ited entirely-or, at best, boxed away in some remote location 
far from any serious, consequential human endea vor- while 
every aspect of life is reduced to some kind of elaborate, rule­
bound game. It's not that such a vision lacks appeal.Who hasn't 
204 The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All 
dreamed of a world where every one knows the rules, everyone 
plays by the rules, and-even more-where people who play 
by the rules can actually still win? The problem is that this is just 
as much a utopian fantasy as a world of absolute free play would 
be. It will always remain a glimm ering illusion that dissolves 
away as soon as we touch it. 
Such illusions are not always bad things . One could make a 
case that most of the greatest human accomplishments were the 
result of such quixotic pursuits. But in this particular case, and 
in this larger political-economic context, where bureaucracy 
has been the primary means by which a tiny percentage of 
the population extracts wealth fr�m the rest of us, they have 
created a situation where the pursuit of freedom from arbitrary 
power simply ends up producing more arbitrary power, and as 
a result, regulations choke exis tence, armed guards and surveil­
lance cameras appear everywhere, science and creativity are 
smothered, and all of us end up finding increasing percentages 
of our day taken up in the filling out of forms. 
205 Appendix 
On Batman and the 
Problem of 
Con stituent Power 
I am appendin g this piece, ostensibly about the Christopher Nolan 
film The Dark Knight Rises -the lon g version ef a piece published 
under the title "Sup er Position " in The New Inquiry in 2012-as 
it expands on themes ef sovereignty and popular culture broached in 
the third essay in this book. In that essay, I noted that there were 
three historically independent elements that I believed came together in 
our notion ef "the state," which I described as sovereignty, bureaucr acy, 
and (heroic ) politics. My thoughts on sovereignty, however, were only 
minimally developed, so I thought it might interest the reader to see 
some further reflections on the subject, written in the same broad, dis­
cursive vein. 
On Sa turd ay, October r, 2orr, the NYPD arrested seven hun­
dred Occupy W all Street activists as they were attempting to 
march across the Brooklyn Bridge. Mayor Bloomberg justified 
it on the grounds that protestors were blocking traffic. Five 
207 The Utopia of Rules 
weeks later, that same Mayor Bloomberg closed down the 
nearby Queensboro Bridge to traffic for two solid days to allow 
for shooting of Christopher Nolan's last installment of his Bat­
man Trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises. 
Many remarked upon the irony. 
A few weeks ago, I went to see the film with some friends 
from Occ upy -most of whom had themselves been arrested on 
the bridge back in October. We all knew the movie was basi­
cally one long piece of anti-Occupy propaganda. That didn't 
bother us. We went to the theater hoping to have fun with that 
fact, in much the spirit of someone who was not a racist, or a 
Nazi, and would go to watch a screening of Birth of a Nation or 
Triumph of the Will. We expected the movie to be hostile, even 
offensive. But none of us expected it to be bad. 
I'd like to reflect here, for a moment, on what made the film 
so awful. Because, oddly, it's important. I think the understand­
ing of a lot of things- about mov ies, violence, police, the very 
nature of state power-can be furthered simply by trying to 
unravel what, exac tly, made The Dark Kni ght so bad. 
One issue I think we should get straight from the outset. 
The film really is a piece of anti-Occu py propaganda. Some 
still deny it. Christopher Nolan, the dire ctor, went on record to 
insist the script was written before the movement even started, 
and has claimed the famous scenes of the occupation of New 
York ("Gotham") were really inspired by Dickens's account of 
the French Revo lution, not by OWS itself. This strikes me as 
disingenu ous. Everyone knows Hollyw ood scripts are rewritten 
continually over the conrse of production, of ten to the point 
where they end up looking nothing like the original text; also, 
that when it comes to messaging, even details like where a 
scene is shot ("I know, let's have the cops face off with Bane's 
followers right in front of the New York Stock Exchange !") or 
208 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
a minor change of wording ("let's change 'take control of' to 
'occupy' ") can make all the difference. 
Then there's the fact that the villains actually do occupy Wall 
Street, and attack the Stock Exchange. 
What I'd like to · argue is that it's precisely this desire for 
relev ance, the fact that the filmmakers had the courage to 
take on the great issues of the day, which ruins the movie. It's 
especially sad, because the first two movies of the trilogy- Bat­
man Begins and The Dark Knight-had moments of genuine 
eloquence. By making them, Nolan demonstrated that he does 
have interesting things to say about human psycholog y, and 
partic ularly, about the relation of creativity and violence (it's 
hard to imagine a successful action film director wouldn' t).The 
Dark Knight Rises is even more ambitious. It dares to speak on 
a scale and grandeur appropriate to the times. But as a result, it 
stutters into incoherence. 
Moments like thi� are. poten tially enlightening, for one thing, 
because they provide a kind of window , a way to think about 
what superhero movi es, and superheroes in general, are really 
all about. That in turn helps us answer another question: What 
is the reason for the sudden exp losion of such movies to begin 
with-one so dramatic that it sometimes seems comic book­
based movies are replacing sci-fi as the main form of Holly­
wood special effects blockbuster almost as rapiQ.iy as the cop 
movie replaced the We stern as the dominant action genre in 
the seventies? 
Why, in the process, are familiar superheroes suddenly being 
given complex interiority: family backgrounds, emotional 
ambiva lence, moral crises, anxie ty, self-doubt? Or why (equally 
true but less remark ed-on) , does the very fact of their receiving 
a soul seem to force them to also choose some kind of explicit 
political orientation? One could argue that this happened first 
209 The Utopia of Rules 
not with a comic-book character, but with James Bond, who 
in his traditional incarnation, as preternatural foil of evil mas­
terminds, was always a kind of cinematic version of the same 
thing. Casino Royale gave Bond psychological depth.And by the 
very next movie, Bond was saving indigenous communities in 
Bolivia from evil transnational water privat izers. 
Spiderman, too, broke left, just as Batman broke right. In a 
way this makes sense. Superheroes are a product of their histori­
cal origins. Superman is a Depression-era displaced Iowa farm 
boy; Batman, the billionaire playboy, is a scion of the military­
industrial complex that was creat ed,just as he was, at the begin­
ning of Wo rld War II; Peter Parker, a product of the sixties, is 
a smartass working-class kid from Queens who got something 
weird shot into his veins. But again, in the late st , movie, the 
subtext became surprisingly explicit ("you're not a vigilante," 
says the police commander, "you' re an anarch ist!"): particularly 
in the climax, where Spiderman, wounded by a police bul­
let, is rescued by an outbreak of working-class solidarity as 
dozens of crane operators across Manhattan defy city orders 
and mobilize to help him. Nolan's movie was the most politi­
cally ambitious, but it also falls the most obviously flat. Is this 
because the superhero genre does not lend itself to a right-wing 
message? 
Certain ly, this is not the conclusion cultural critics have 
tended to come to in the past. 
What, then, can we say about the politics of the superhero genre? 
It seems reasonable to start by looking at the comic books, since 
this is where everything else (the TV shows, cartoon series, 
blockbuster movies) ultimately came from. Comic-book super­
heroes were originally a mid-century phenomenon and like 
all mid-century pop culture phenomena, they are essentially 
Freudian. That is to say, insofar as a work of popular fiction had 
210 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
anything to say about human nature, or human motivations, a 
certain pop Freudianism is what one would exp ect. Sometimes 
this even becomes ex plicit, as in Forbidden Planet, with its "mon­
sters from the Id." Usual ly, it's just subtext. 
Umberto Eco once remarked that comic book stories 
already operate a little bit like dreams; the same basic plot 
is repeated, obsessive-compul sively, over and over; noth­
ing changes, even as the backdrop for the stories shifts from 
Great Depression to Wo rld War II to postwar prosperity , the 
heroes-whether Superman, Wonder Wo man, the Green 
Hornet, or Dr. Strange- seem to remain in an eternal pres­
ent, never aging, always fundamentally the same. The basic 
plot takes the foll owing form: a bad guy-mayb e a crime 
boss, more often a powerful supervilla in-embarks on a project 
of world conquest, destruction, thef t, extortion, or reve nge. The 
hero is alerted to the danger and figures out what's happening. 
After trials and dilemmas, at the last possible minute, the hero 
foils the villain's plans. The world is returned to normal until the 
next episode when the exact same thing happens once again. 
It doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going on here. 
The heroes are purely reactio nary. By this I mean "reactionary" 
in the literal sense: they simply react to things; they have no 
projects of their own. (Or to be more precise, as heroes they 
have no pro jects of their own. As Clark Kent, Superman may 
be constantly trying, and failing, to get into Lois Lane's pants. 
As Superman, he is purely reactive .) In fact, superheroes seem 
almost utterly lacking in imaginatio n. Bruce Wayne, with all 
the money in the world, can't seem to think of anything to 
do with it other than to design even more high-tech weap­
onry and indulge in the occasional act of char ity. In the same 
way it never seems to occur to Superman that he could easily 
end world hunger or carve free magic cities out of mountains . 
Almost never do superheroes make, create, or build anything. 
The villains, in contrast, are relentlessly creative. They are full 
211 The Utopia of Rules 
of plans and projects and ideas. Clearl y, we are supposed to first, 
without consciously realizing it, identify with the villains. After 
all, they're having all the fun. Then of course we feel guilty for 
it, reidentify with the hero, and have even more fun watching 
the Superego pummel the errant Id back into submission. 
Of course, the moment you start arguing that there's any 
message in a comic book, you are likely to hear the usual objec­
tions: "But these are just cheap forms of entertainment! They're 
no more trying to teach us anything about human nature, 
politics, or society than, say, a Ferris wheel." And of course, 
to a certain degree, this is true. Pop culture does not exist in 
order to convince anyone of anything. It exists for the sake of 
pleasure. Still, if you pay close attention, one will also observe 
that most pop culture projects do also tend to make that very 
pleasure into a kind of argument. Horror films provide a par­
ticularly unsubtle example of how this works. The plot of a 
horror movie is, typically, some kind of story of transgression 
and punishment-in the slasher film, perhaps the purest, most 
stripped-down, least subtle example of the genre, you always 
see the same movement in the plot. As Carol Clover long ago 
noted in her magisterial Men, !%men, and Chainsaws, the audi­
ence is first tacitly encouraged to identify with the monster 
(the camera literally takes the monster's point of view) as he 
hacks away at the "bad girls," and only later, shifting to looking 
through the eyes of the androgynous heroine who will eventu­
ally destroy him. The plot is always a simple story of transgres­
sion and punishment: the bad girls sin, they have sex, they fail 
to report a hit-and-run accident, maybe they're just obnoxious, 
stupid teenagers; as a result, they are eviscerated. Then the vir­
ginal good girl eviscerates the culprit. It's all very Christian and 
moralistic. The sins may be minor and the punishment utterly 
disproportionate, but the ultimate message is: "Of course they 
really deserve it; we all do; whatever our civi lized exterior, we 
are all fundamentally corrupt and evil. The proof? Wel l, look at 
212 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
yourself. You're not evil? If you're not evil, then why are you 
getting off on watching this sadistic crap?" 
This is what I mean when I say the pleasure is a form of 
argument. 
Next to this, a superhero comic book might seem pretty 
innocuous. And in many ways it is. If all a comic is doing is 
telling a bunch of adolescent boys that everyo ne has a cer­
tain desire for chaos and mayhem, but that ultimately such 
desires need to be controlled, the political implications would 
not seem to be particularly dire. Especially because the mes­
sage still does carry a healthy dose of ambival ence, just as it 
does with all those contemporary action-movie heroes who 
seem to spend so much of their time smashing up suburban 
shopping malls and suchlike. Most of us would like to smash 
a bank or shopping mall at least once in our lives. And as 
Bakunin put it, "the urge for destruction is also a creative 
urge." 
Still, I think there is reason to believe that at least in the case 
of most comic-book superheroes, the mayhem does have very 
conservative political implications. To understand why though 
I will have to enter into a brief digression on the question of 
constituent power. 
Costumed superheroes ultimately battle criminals in the name 
of the law-even if they themselves often operate outside a 
strictly legal framework. But in the modern state, the very status 
of law is a proble m. This is because of a basic logical paradox: 
no system can generate itself. Any power capable of creating a 
system of laws cannot itself be bound by them. So law has to 
come from someplace else. In the Middle Ages the solution was 
simple: the legal order was created by God, a being who, as the 
Old Testament makes abundantly clear, is not bound by laws 
or even any recognizable system of morality (again, this only 
213 The Utopia of Rules 
stands to reason: if you created morali ty, you can't, by definition, 
be bound by it). Or if not by God direc tly, then by the divinely 
ordained power of kings. The English, American, and French 
revolutionaries changed all that when they created the notion 
of popular Sovere ignty-declaring that the power once held by 
kings is now held by an entity that they called "the people."This 
created an immediate logical problem, because "the people" are 
by definition a group of individuals united by the fact that they 
are, in fact, bound by a certain set of laws. So in what sense 
can they have created those laws? When this question was first 
posed in the wake of the British, American, and French revolu­
tions, the answer seemed obvious: through those revo lutions 
themselves. But this created a further problem. Revolutions are 
acts of law-b reaking. It is completely illegal to rise up in arms, 
overthrow a gov ernment, and create a new political order. In 
fact, nothing could pos sibly be more illegal. Cromwell, Jeffer­
son, or Danton were all clearly guilty of treason, according to 
the laws under which they grew up,just as much as they would 
have been had they tried to do the same thing again under the 
new regimes they created, say, twenty years later. 
So laws emerge from illegal activity. This creates a funda­
mental incoherence in the very idea of modern government, 
which assumes that the state has a monopoly of the legitimate 
use of violence (only the police, or prison guards, or duly au­
thorized private security , have the legal right to beat you up). 
It's legitimate for the police to use violence because they are 
enforcing the law; the law is legitimate because it's rooted in 
the constitution; the constitution is legitimate because it comes 
from the people; the people created the constitution by acts 
of illegal violence. The obvious question, then: How does one 
tell the difference between "the people" and a mere rampag­
ing mob? 
There is no obvious answer. 
The response by mainstream, respectable opinion is to try to 
214 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
push the problem as far away as possible. The usual liue is: the 
age of revolutions is over (except perhaps in benighted spots like 
Gabon, or mayb e Syria) ; we can now change the constitution, 
or legal standards, by legal means . This of course means that the 
basic structures will never change. We can witness the results in 
the United States, which continues to maintain an architecture 
of state, with its electoral college and two party-system, that­
while quite progressive in 178CJ-now makes us appear, in the 
eyes of the rest of the world, the political equivalent of the Amish, 
still driving around with horses and buggies . It also means we 
base the legitimacy of the whole system on the consent of the 
people despite the fact that the only people who were ever 
really consulted on the matter lived over two hundred years ago. 
In America, at least, "the people" are all long since dead. 
We 've gone then from a situation where the power to create 
a legal order derives from God, to one where it derives from 
armed revo lution, to one where it is rooted in sheer tradition- · -
"these are the customs of our ancestors, who are we to doubt 
their wisdom?" (And of course a not insigni ficant number of 
American politicians make clear they'd really like to give it back 
to God again.) 
This, as I say, is how these matters are considered by the 
mainstream. For the radical Left, and the authoritarian Right, 
the problem of constituent power is very much alive, but each 
takes a diametrically opposite approach to the fundamental 
question of violence. The Left, chastened by the disasters of 
the twentieth century , has largely moved away from its older 
celebration of revolutionary violence, preferring nonvi olent 
forms of resistance . Those who act in the name of something 
higher than the law can do so precisely because they don't act 
like a rampaging mob. For the Right, on the other hand-and 
this has been true since the rise of fascism in the twenties-the 
very idea that there is something special about revo lutionary 
violence, anything that makes it different from mere criminal 
215 The Utopia of Rules 
violence, is so much self-righteous twaddle. Violence is vio­
lence. But that doesn't mean a rampaging mob can't be "the 
people" because violence is the real source oflaw and political 
order anyway. Any successful deployment of violence is, in its 
own way, a form of constituent power. This is why, as Walter 
Ben jamin noted, we cannot help but admire the "great crimi­
nal": because, as so many movie posters over the years have 
put it, "he makes his own law: ' After all, any criminal organiza­
tion does, inevi tably, begin developing its own-often quite 
elaborate -set of internal rules and regulations. They have to, 
as a way of controlling what would otherwise be completely 
random violence. But from the right-wing perspective, that's all 
that law ever is. It is a means of controlling the very violence 
that brings it into being, and through which it is ultimately 
enfor ced. 
This makes it easier to understand the often otherwise sur­
prising affinity between criminals, criminal gangs, right-wing 
political move ments, and the armed representatives of the state. 
Ultimatel y, they all speak the same language. They create their 
own rules on the basis of force.As a result, such people typically 
share the same broad political sensibilitie s. Mussolini might have 
wiped out the mafia, but Italian Mafiosi still idolize Mussolini. 
In Athens, nowada ys, there's active collaboration between the 
crime bosses in poor immigrant neighb orhoods, fascist gangs, 
and the police. In fact, in this case it was clearly a political 
strategy: faced with the prosp ect of popular uprisings against 
a right-wing government, the police first withdrew protection 
from neighborhoods near the immigrant gangs, then started 
giving tacit support to the fascists (the result was the rapid rise 
of an overtly Nazi party. Roughly half of Greek police were 
reported to have voted for the Nazis in the last election) . But 
this is just how far-right politics work. For them, it is in that 
space where different violent forces operating outside of the 
legal order (or in the case of the police, sometimes just barely 
216 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
inside it) inter-act where new forms of power, hence order, can 
emerge. 
So what does all this have to do with costumed superheroes? 
Well, everything. Because this is exactly the space that superhe­
roes, and super-villains, also inha bit. An inherently fascist space, 
inhabited only by gang sters, would-be dictators, police, and 
thugs, with endlessly blurring lines between them. Sometimes 
the cops are legalistic , sometimes corru pt. Sometimes the police 
themselves slip into vigilantism. Sometimes they persecute the 
superhero, at others they look the other way, or help. Villains 
and heroes occasionally team up. The lines of force are always 
shif ting. If anything new were to emerge, it could only be 
through such shifting forces. There's nothing else, since in the 
DC and Marvel univ erses, God, or The People, simply doesn't 
exist. 
Insofar as there is a potential for constituent power then, 
it can only come from purveyors of violence. And indeed, the 
supervillains and evil masterminds, when they are not merely 
dreaming of committing the perf ect crime or indulging in 
random acts of terror, are always scheming of imposing a New 
Wo rld Order of some kind or another. Surely, if Red Skull, 
Kang the Conqueror, or Doctor Doom ever did succeed in 
taking over the planet, a host of new laws would be created 
very quickly. They wouldn't be very nice laws . Their creator 
would doubtless not himself feel bound by them. But one 
gets the feeling that otherwise, they would be quite strictly 
enforced. 
Superheroes resist this logic.They do not wish to conquer the 
world-if only because they are not monomaniacal or insane. 
As a result, they remain parasitical off the villains in the same 
way that police remain parasitical off criminals: without them, 
they would have no reason to exist. They remain defenders of 
217 The Utopia of Rules 
a legal and political order which itself seems to' have come out 
of nowhere, and which, however faulty or degraded, must be 
defended, because the only alternative is so much worse. 
They aren't fascists. They are just ordinar y, decent, super­
powerful people who inhabit a world in which fascism is the 
only political possi bility. 
Why, might we ask, would a form of entertainment premised 
on such a peculiar notion of politics emerge in early- to mid­
twenti eth-century America, at just around the time that actual 
fascism was on the rjse in Europ e? Was it some kind of fantasy 
American equiv alent? Not exac tly. It's more that both fascism 
and superheroes were products of a similar historical predica­
ment: What is the foundation of social order when one has 
exorcised the very idea of revolu tion? And above all, what hap­
pens to the political imagination? 
One might begin here by considering who are the core audi­
ence for superhero comics. Mainly, adolescent or preadolescent 
white boys. That is, individuals who are at a point in their lives 
where they are likely to be both maximally imaginative and 
at least a little bit rebellious; but who are also being groomed 
to eventually take on positions of authority and power in the 
world, to be fathers, sheriffs, small-business owners, middle 
managers, enginee rs.And what do they learn from these endless 
repeated dramas? We ll, first off, that imagination and rebellion 
lead to violence; second, that, like imagination and rebellion, 
violence is a lot of fun; third, that, ultimatel y, violence must be 
directed back against any overflow of imagination and rebel­
lion lest everything go askew. These things must be containe d! 
This is why insofar as superheroes are allowed to be imaginative 
in any way, it could only be extended to the design of their 
clothes, their cars, maybe their homes, their various accessories. 
218 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
It's in this sense that the logic of the superhero plot is pro­
foundl y, deeply conse rvative. Ultimatel y, the division between 
left-and right-wing sensibilities turns on one's attitude towards 
the imagination. For the Left, imaginati on, creati vity, by exten­
sion production, the power to bring new things and new social 
arrangements into being, is always to be celebrated. It is the 
source of all real value in the world. For the Right, it is danger­
ous; ultimat ely, evil. The urge to create is also a destructive urge. 
This kind of sensibility was rife in the popular Freudianism of 
the day: where the Id was the motor of the psyche, but also 
amoral; if really unleashed, it would lead to an orgy of destruc­
tion. This is also what separates conser vatives ftom fascists. Both 
agree that the imagination unleashed can only lead to violence 
and destruction. Conserv atives wish to defend us against that 
possibility. Fascists wish to unleash it anyway. They aspire to be, 
as Hitler imagined himself, great artists painting with the minds, 
blood, and sinews of humanity. 
This means that it's not just the mayhem that becomes the 
reader's guilty pleasure, but the very fact of having a fantasy 
life at all. And while it might seem odd to think any artistic 
genre is ultimately a warning about the dangers of the human 
imaginati on, it would certain explain why, in the staid forties 
and fifti es, everyone did seem to feel there was something 
vaguely naughty about reading them. It also explains how 
in the sixties it could all suddenly seem so harmless, allow­
ing the advent of silly, campy TV superheroes like the Adam 
We st Batman series, or Saturday morning Spiderman cartoons. 
If the message was that rebellious imagination was okay 
as long as it was kept out of politics and simply confined to 
consumer choices (clothes, cars, accessories again) , this had 
become a message that even executive producers could easily 
get behind. 
219 The Utopia of Rules 
We can conclude: the classic comic book is ostensibly political 
(about madmen trying to tkke over the world) , really psycho­
logical and personal (about overcoming the dangers of rebel� 
lious adolescence) , but ultimatel y, political after all.171 
If this is so, then new superhero movies are precisely the 
reverse. They are ostensibly psychological and personal, really 
political, but ultimat ely, psychological and personal after all. 
The humanization of superheroes didn't start in the movie s. It 
actually began in the eighties and nineties, within the comic 
book genre itself, with Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns 
and Alan Moore's Watchmen-a subgenre of what might be 
called superhero noir. At that time, superhero movies were srill 
working through the legacy of the sixties camp tradition, as 
in Christopher Reeve's Superman series, or Michael Keaton's 
Batman. Eventuall y, though, the noir subgenre, probably always 
somewhat cinematic in its inspiration, came to Hollywood as 
well. One might say it reached its cinematic peak in Batman 
Begins, the first of the Nolan trilogy. In that movie, Nolan essen­
tially asks, "What if someone like Batman actually did exist? 
How would that happen? What would it actually take to make 
an otherwise respectable member of society decide to dress up 
as a bat and prowl the streets in search of criminals?" 
Unsurpris ingly, psychedelic drugs turn out to play an impor­
tant role here. So do severe mental health issues and bizarre 
religious cults. 
It is curious that commentators on the movie never seem 
to pick up on the fact that Bruce Wayne, in the Nolan films, 
is borderline psychotic. As himself he is almost completely 
dysfunctional, incapable of forming friendships or romantic 
attachments, uninterested in work unless it somehow reinf orces 
his morbid obsessions. The hero is so obviously crazy, and the 
movie so obviously about his battle with his own craziness, 
220 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
that it's not a problem that the villains are just a series of ego­
appendages: Ra's al Ghul (the bad father) , the Crime boss (the 
successful businessman) , the Scarecr ow (who drives the busi­
nessman insane.) There's nothing particularly appealing about 
any of them. But it doesn't matter-they're all just shards and 
fessera of the hero's shattered mind.As a result, we don't have to 
identify with the villain and then recoil in self-loathing; we can 
just enjoy watching Bruce do that for us. 
There's also no obvious a political message. 
Or so it seems.But when you create a movie out of characters 
so dense with myth and history, no director is entirely in con­
trol of his material. The filmmaker's role is largely to assemble 
them. In the movie, the primary villain is Ra's al Ghul, who first 
initiates Batman into the League of Shadows in a monastery in 
Bhutan, and only then reveals his plan to destroy Gotham to 
rid the world of its corruption. In the original comics, we learn 
that Ra's al Ghul (a character intro duced, tellingl y, in 1971) is 
in fact a Primitivist and ecoterrorist, determined to restore the 
balance of nature by reducing the earth's human population by 
roughly 99 percent. The main way Nolan changed the story is 
to make Batman begin as Ra's al Ghul's disciple. But in con­
temporary terms that, too, makes a sort of sense. After all, what is 
the media stereotype that immediately comes to mind-at least 
since the direct actions against the Wo rld Trade Organization in 
Seattle-when one thinks of a trust-fund kid who, moved by 
some unfathomable sense of injustice, dons black clothing and 
a mask, and takes to the streets to create violence and mayhem, 
though always in a way calculated never to actually kill anyo ne? 
Let alone one who does so inspired by the teachings of a radical 
guru who believes we need to return to the Stone Age? Nolan 
made his hero a Black Bloc disciple of John Zerzan who breaks 
with his former mentor when he realizes what restoring Eden 
will actually entail. 
In fact, none of the villains in any of the three movies wants 
221 The Utopia of Rules 
to rule the world. They don't wish to have power over others, 
or to create new rules of any sort. Even ,their henchmen are 
temporary expedien ts-they always ultimately plan to kill them. 
Nolan's villains are always anarchists. But they're also always 
very peculiar anarchists, of a sort that seem to exist only in the 
filrnrnaker's imagination: anarchists who believe that human 
nature is fundamentally evil and corrupt. The Joker, the real 
hero of the second movie, makes all of this explicit: he's basi­
cally the Id become philosopher. The Joker is nameless, he has 
no origin other than whatever he, on any particular occasion, 
whimsically inve nts; it's not even clear what his powers are or 
where they came from.Y et he's inexorably powerf ul. The Joker 
is a pure force of self-creation, a poem written by himself; and 
his only purpose in life appears to be an obsessive need to prove 
to others first, that everything is and can only be poet ry-and 
second, that poetry is evil. 
So here we are back to the central theme of the early super­
hero univ erses: a prolonged refle ction on the dangers of the 
human imagination; how the reader's own desire to immerse 
oneself in a world driven by artistic imperatives is living proof 
of why the imagination must always be care fully contained. 
The result is a thrilling movie, with a villain both like­
able--he 's just so obviously having fun with it-and genuinely 
frightening. Batman Begins was merely full of people talking 
about fear. The Dark Knight actually produced some. But even 
that movie began to fall fl.at the moment it touches on popular 
politics. The People make one lame attempt to intervene in 
the beginning of when copycat Batmen appear all over the 
city, inspired by the Dark Knight's example. Of course they all 
die horribly and that's the end of that. From then on, they're 
put back in their place, as Audience, who like the mob in the 
Roman amphitheater exist only to judge the protagonists' per­
formance: thumbs-up for Batman, thumbs-down for Batman, 
thumbs-up for the crusading DA ... The end, when Bruce and 
222 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
Commissioner Gordon settle on the plan to scapegoat Bat­
man and create a false myth around the martyrdom of Harvey 
Dent, is nothing short of a conf ession that politics is identical 
to the art of fiction. The Joker was right. To a degree. As always, 
redemption lies only in the fact that the violence, the decep­
tion, can be turned back upon itself. 
They would have done well leave it that. 
The problem with this vision of politics is that it simply isn't 
true. Politics is not just the art of manipulating images, backed 
up by violenc e. It's not really a duel between impresarios before 
an audience that will believe most anything if presented artfully 
enough. No doubt it must seem that way to extraordinarily 
wealthy Hol lywo od film directors. But between the shooting of 
the first and second movies, history intervened quite decisively 
to point out just how wrong this vision is. The economy col­
lapsed. Not because of the manipulations of some secret society 
of warrior monks , but because a bunch of financial managers 
who, living in Nolan's bubble world, shared his assumptions 
about the endlessness of popular manipulability, turned out to 
be wrong. There was a mass popular resp onse. It did not take 
the form of a frenetic search for messianic savi ors, mixed with 
outbreaks of nihilist violenc e;'" increasing ly, it took the form of 
a series of real popular movements, even revolutionary move­
ments, toppling regimes in the Middle East and occupying 
squares everywhere from Cleveland to Kar achi, trying to create 
new forms of democr acy. 
Constituent power had reappeared, and in an imaginative, 
radical, and remarkably nonvi olent form. This is precisely the 
kind of situation a superhero universe cannot addr ess. In Nolan's 
world, something like Occupy could only have been the prod­
uct of some tiny group of ingenious manipulators (you know, 
people like me) who are really pursuing some secret agenda. 
Nolan really should have left such topics alone, but appar­
ently, he couldn't help himself. The result is almost completely 
223 The Utopia of Rules· 
incoherent. It. is, basic ally, yet another psychological drama 
masquerading as a political one. The plot is convoluted and 
barely worth recounting. Bruce Way ne, dysfunctional again 
without his alter ego, has turned into a recl use.A rival business­
man hires Catwoman to steal his fingerprints so he can use 
them to steal all his money; but really the businessman is being 
manipulated by a gas-mask-wearing supervillain mercenary 
named Bane. Bane is stronger than Batman but he's basically 
a miserable sort of person, pining with unrequited love for 
Ra's al Ghul's daughter Talia, crippled by mistreatment in his 
youth in a dunge on-like prison where he was cast unjustly, his 
face invisible behind a mask he must wear continually so as not 
to collapse in agonizing pain. Insofar as the audience identifies 
with a villain like that, it can only be out of sympa thy. No one 
in her right mind would want to be Bane. But presumably that's 
the point: a warning against the dangers of undue sympathy for 
the unfortunate. Because Bane is also a charismatic revolution­
ary, who, after disposing of Batman, reveals the myth of Harvey 
Dent to be a lie, frees the denizens of Gotham's prisons, and 
releases its ever- impressionable populace to sack and burn the 
mansions of the r percent, and to drag their denizens before 
revolutionary tribunal s. (The Scarecr ow, amusingly, reappears as 
Robespierre.) But really he's ultimately intending to kill them 
all with a nuclear bomb converted from some kind of green 
energy project.Why?Who knows? Maybe he too is some kind 
of Primitivist ecoterrorist like Ra's al Ghul. (He does seem to 
have inherited the headship of the same organ ization.) Maybe 
he's trying to impress Talia by finishing her father's work. Or 
maybe he's just evil and there's no need for further explanati on. 
Conversely, why does Bane wish to lead the people in a 
social revolution, if he's just going to nuke them all in a few 
weeks anyway? Again, it's anybody's guess. He says that before 
you destroy someone, first you must give them hope. So is the 
message that utopian dreams can only lead to nihilistic violence? 
224 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
Presumably something like that, but it's singul arly unconvinc­
ing, since the plan to kill every one came first. The revolution 
was a decor ative afterthought. 
In fact, what happens to the city can only poss ibly make 
sense as a material echo of what's always been most impor­
tant: what's happening in Bruce Wayne's tortured brain. After 
Batman is crippled by Bane halfWay through the movie, he is 
placed in the same fetid dungeon where Bane himself was once 
imprisoned. The prison sits at the bottom of a well, so sunlight 
is always taunting its inhabitants-but the well is impossible to 
climb. Bane ensures Bruce is nursed back to health just so he 
can try and fail to scale it, and thus know that it's his failure 
that allowed his beloved Gotham to be destroye d. Only then 
will Bane be merciful enough to kill him. This is contriv ed, 
but psychologica lly, at least, you can say it makes some kind of 
sense. Translated onto the level of a city, it makes no sense at all: 
why would anyone want to give a population hope and then 
unexpectedly vaporize them? The first is cruel. The second is 
just random. And not only that, the filmmakers compound the 
metaphor by having Bane play the same trick on the Gotham 
police department, who-in a plot contrivance so idiotic it 
violates even the standards of plausibility expected from a 
comic book -are almost all lured beneath the city and then 
trapp ed there by well-placed bombs, except then for some rea­
son allowed to receive food and water, presumably so they too 
can be tortured by hope. 
Other things happen, but they're all similar projec tions. 
This time Catwoman gets to play the role usually assigned to 
the audience, first identifying with Bane's revolu tionary project, 
then, for no clearly articulated reason, changing her mind and 
blowing him away. Batman and the Gotham police both rise 
from their respective dungeons and join forces to battle the 
evil Occ upiers outside the Stock Exchange. In the end, Batman 
fakes his own death disposing of the bomb and Bruce ends up 
225 The Utopia of Rules 
with Catwoman in Florence. A new phony martyr legend is 
born and the people of Gotham are pacified. In case of further 
trouble, we are assured there is also a potential heir to Batman, a 
disil lusioned police officer named Robin. Everyone breathes 
a sigh of relief because the movie is finally over. 
Is there supposed to be a message we can all take home from 
this? If there was, it would seeni to be something along the 
lines of this: "True, the system is corrupt, but it's all we have, 
and anywa y, figures of authority can be trusted if they have 
first been chastened and endured terrible suffering." (Normal 
police let children die on bridges. Police who've been buried 
alive for a few weeks can employ violence legitimately.) "True, 
there is injustice and its victims deserve our sympa thy, but 
keep it within reasonable limits. Charity is much better than 
·addressing structural problems. That way lies madness." Because 
in Nolan's universe, any attempt to address structural problems, 
e.ven through nonviolent civil disobedience, really is a form 
of violenc e; because that's all it could possibly be. Imaginative 
politics are inherently violent, and therefore, there's nothing 
inappropriate if police respond by smashing apparently peaceful 
protestors' heads repeatedly against the concrete. 
As a response to Occupy, this is nothing short of pathetic. 
When The Dark Knight came out in 2008, there was much dis­
cussion over whether the whole thing was really a vast metaphor 
for the war on terror: how far is it okay for the good guys (that's 
us) to go adapting the bad guy's metho ds? Probably the film­
makers were indeed thinking of such issues, and still managed 
to produce a good movie. But then, the war on terror actually 
was a battle of secret networks and manipulative spectacles. 
It began with a bomb and ended with an assassinat ion. One 
can almost think of it as an attempt, on both sides, to actually 
enact a comic book version of the unive rse. Once real con­
stituent power appeared on the scene, that universe shriveled 
into incoherence-even came to seem ridiculo us. Revolutions 
226 On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power 
were sweeping the Middle East, and the United States were still 
spending hundreds of billions of dollars fighting a ragtag bunch 
of seminary students in Afghanistan. Unf ortunately for Nolan, 
for all his manipulative pow ers, the same thing happened to
